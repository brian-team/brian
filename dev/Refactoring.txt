Refactoring Brian
=================
Abstract: I propose to do some refactoring to improve the readability of the code,
in order to welcome new developers in the future (see also BEP 4).

Priority #1 = developer's guide

*** Simplify connection.py and equations.py ***

Increase modularity
-------------------
As much as possible, you should try to have independent modules, which could be
developed and maintained by people who don't know the rest of the code. These should
be all those that do not import any Brian module.

Here is a list of such modules:
* globalprefs
* inspection
* log
* magic
* optimiser
* units
* unitsafefunctions
* stdunits
* library.*
* utils.*
Those modules should be better documented/tested, so that external people could start
working on it. The plotting module should be made more independent.
A list of tests for those modules could quickly be established by searching for places
where methods are called (in the rest of Brian).

Unify syntax
------------
See BEP 4.

Separate C code from pure Python
--------------------------------
Each class could have a separate pure Python implementation and C implementation.
For example, there could be a CircularVector class and a CircularVector_C class, and
using the latter would simply be done by the line:
CircularVector=CircularVector_C
Alternatively, the separation could be at the level of methods rather than classes,
and the switch could be done at initialization.

Another option is to have a separate module for the C implementation, e.g. circular_c.py,
which would redefine some of the classes, and the last lines of circular.py would import
circular_c if C code is switched on. The advantage of this option is that it simplifies
the code. The C modules could also be gathered in a specific folder.

Problem: synchronization of C and Python code.
Solution(?): testing with and without weave/swig.

Integration methods
-------------------
A template mechanism could be provided, which would help people write their own
integration methods.

Code generation
---------------
Instead of doing code generation ourselves, maybe we could leave that to Numpy,
e.g. with the lazy evaluation ideas.
There is a great project named Theano which seem to do what we need:
http://www.pylearn.org/theano/
Unfortunately there is no Windows build at the moment.

There is another module called numexpr, which accelerates Numpy evaluations,
and it seems rather stable. Versions > 1.2 crash. The acceleration is significant
only for very large vectors (>100 000) or transcendental functions.

Cleaning
--------
* Move obsolete modules/methods to a specific folder
(which ones?)
* Remove dead code (tool?)

Obsolete modules:
* quantityarray: TODO after release

For the cleaning operations, we should find automation tools.

Tests
-----
It should be easier for people to add new tests.
Maybe the tests should be outside the modules (possibly in a specific folder).
