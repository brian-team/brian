Creating a new release of Brian
===============================

Many of these steps can be done now using the Jenkins Continuous Integration
server (hal.dec.ens.fr:8080) -- for completeness both ways (using Jenkins vs.
doing it manually) are illustrated under the different subheadings. Note that
you only have to do one of them!

You need the following packages installed:

* Sphinx version 0.6+
* latex (if building PDF documentation)
  
Regression testing
------------------

Using Jenkins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This should be done automatically:
The tests are run after every commit, the examples are tested nightly. But it
certainly does not hurt to do it manually as well:

Manually
~~~~~~~~
Run dev/tests/alltests.py and if possible dev/tests/allexamples.py. Note
that some of the allexamples.py tests will fail for known reasons (check
individual files to make sure).

Update the version number
-------------------------
(Has to be done manually)

Run dev/tools/newrelease/setversion.py, which will prompt you to type
the new version number. We use the convention:

major.minor.patch[a|b|rc1|rc2|etc.]

where minor introduces significant new features and patch only introduces
minor features or fixes bugs.

Update README.txt and brian/new_features.txt
--------------------------------------------
(Has to be done manually)
Copy the latest new features from new_features.txt into README.txt
following the convention there, and make a new section in new_features.txt
for the next version. You should also go through the commit log from the time
of the last release, to check for features that people have forgotten to add to
new_features.txt. This is also a good way to find things that should be but
aren't documented, etc.

Also, you might want to update README.txt as well if there are significant
changes such as new web page, new authors, new requirements, etc.

Build the documentation
-----------------------

This probably doesn't need to be done for patch level releases, only
minor and major releases.

Using Jenkins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Select "Build Now" for the "Documentation" job. After the job has finished 
successfully, it should provide a file `docs.zip` containing the HTML and PDF
documentation, this should be uploaded as the docs folder to the website.

Note that Jenkins does currently not have access to the "More Brian" SVN
therefore it can't be used to make a new BrianReference.pdf.

Manually
~~~~~~~~
First of all, run the dev/tools/docs/generate_html.py script. This will
generate all the relevant HTML files for the documentation other
than the API documentation. Note that you need to check that no errors are
raised, and fix them if they are.

Secondly, build the PDF version of the documentation by running
dev/tools/docs/build_latex.py. Copy the file
docs_sphinx/_latexbuild/Brian.pdf to docs.

Finally, if necessary make a new BrianReference.pdf from the doc file on
the "More Brian" SVN.

The docs folder should be copied to the website.

Update setup.py
---------------
(Has to be done manually)
The setup.py file is the install script for Brian and also contains
the information that defines what people see on the pypi site, and
what the requirements are for easy_install and so forth, so it's
important to get the information right.

Extras folders:
	The extras_folders variable specifies which files are included
	in the extras zip file, this doesn't usually need updating
	unless there has been a change in structure of Brian (the
	most likely being new examples subdirectories).
py_modules:
	Lists the extra modules not part of the main Brian package,
	most likely this doesn't need to be changed.
packages:
	Lists the subpackages inside Brian, every package within a
	package needs to be listed explicitly so this may have changed.
requires:
	The minimum versions of various packages to make Brian work.
url, description, long_description, author, author_email, download_url:
	Most likely these won't change much, but when we change the web site
	or our email addresses for example, these might change.
classifiers:
	Most likely these won't change either, there are standard names for
	these which you can look up on the PyPI site. 

You can use the track_files.py script to help with this. It tracks all the
files in the Brian distribution and asks you whether or not you want to
include them in the release or extras files. See the docstring for more info.
If there are files which should be included but aren't, you need to change
the setup.py file.

Create the distribution files
-----------------------------

Using Jenkins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Select "Build now" for the "Release" Job -- after it finished it should provide
the .zip, .tar.gz and .exe files. Note that any changes to the MANIFEST.in
files (see below) have to be done manually before running the job.

Manually
~~~~~~~~
First if you have a copy, delete the MANIFEST file. Next, if necessary,
update the MANIFEST.in file which specifies which files should be
included in the distribution. At the moment, we have an inclusive
rule, include all Python and SWIG files.

Now run the dev/tools/create_dist.py file which should have create
three files brian-versionname.win32.exe,
brian-versionname.tar.gz and brian-versionname.zip in the dist
directory. Check (in the ZIP version for example) that all the files
you expect to be there are there.

You can now delete old versions (they're still available
on the SVN, but don't take up unnecessary space).

Create the extras file
----------------------

Using Jenkins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Select "Build now" for the "Extras" jobs.

Manually
~~~~~~~~
Just run the create_extras.py file. This should create
dist/brian-versionname-extras.zip.

Test the distribution
---------------------
(Has to be done manually)

First uninstall any installed copy of Brian you have on your machine,
but not the SVN version. Do this by going to Add/Remove programs in
Windows settings, and looking for 'Python 2.5 brian' and removing it.

Now install Brian using the Windows installer. Open IPython, type::

	from brian import *
	run_all_tests()

Note the directory it is running from (this should be in the Python
site-packages directory, not the SVN location).

Once you've verified that it all works, you can uninstall the installed
version of Brian (which is used in preference to the SVN version).

Upload to Trac
--------------

Go to our Trac page:

	https://neuralensemble.org/trac/brian/wiki
	
Login, go to Admin, click on Downloader. Create a new release under
Official Releases with the version number as the name of the release.
Make sure the order is right (look at the most recent one and subtract 1). Select
the release and upload each file as in the examples already there. Make sure
to edit the Download page on the Trac Wiki to point to the new release.

Upload to PyPI
--------------
Using Jenkins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Select "Build now" for the "PyPI upload" job and enter the username and
password for you PyPI account.

Manually
~~~~~~~~
You use the dev/tools/newrelease/register_pypi.py script to register
the data on PyPI. Note that you need a PyPI account that is authorised
to make changes to Brian. Also note that you need a file .pypirc in
your home directory which should be be a text file like:

	[server-login]
	username:...
	password:...

The HOME environment variable must be set to point
to your home directory (which is not standard in Windows). Due to a
bug in distutils, on Windows this HOME environment variable cannot have
any spaces in it, so use the old 8.3 filename, e.g. on my laptop at
home it is C:\DOCUME~1\DANGOO~1.

Commit to SVN
-------------
(Has to be done manually)

At this point, make a commit to the SVN with a large notice in the commit
comment such as ****** BRIAN 1.2.0 ******. Also, create an SVN tag with this
release (svn copy /trunk to /tags/1.2.0 for example).

Set the version to the next planned release
-------------------------------------------
(Has to be done manually)

Run setversion.py and enter the next planned version with 'dev' on the
end, e.g. 1.1.4dev. This is so that weekly releases will be marked as
dev versions for support.

Announce the release
--------------------

Announce on the web page and the brian support mailing list.

Also, update the version number in the wikipedia entry for Brian!
