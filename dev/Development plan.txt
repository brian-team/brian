Brian Development plan
----------------------

How about we launch a survey? We can easily create a web form with google, and
have questions about what users would like to see in next versions.

Meeting notes:

* First thing: complete GPUNeuronGroup, using threshold/reset in model fitting
  (B/C) + Issam's compaction algorithms.
	-> October
* Brian Hears: remove all transfers.
	-> start a BEP

[R]* Analyse weblogs on documentation's website
* Examples for our papers
[R]* BEP on event-driven STDP / nonlinear synapses + examples

* Survey on comp-neuro + at installation time + analysis of user's code
-> October
This is in a google form (check in your google docs to edit it):
https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEVlaTVFczBDS1FtZW5wYXl3cmFpVFE6MQ

* Test new model fitting

* Version 1.4 (October):
	* MultiLinear...
	* New model fitting
	* Refractoriness
	* Metrics
	* New SpikeGeneratorGroup

1) GPU
------
[BDV]* Start with Brian Hears. Essentially, GPU kernels are done but we need
to remove all GPU<->CPU transfers. Ideally, we would just transfer spikes
(and so it would be good if neuron groups can include noise/Poisson firing).

[BCD]* For Brian: maybe have a first version that is not entirely transparent to
the user?
	* First a non-transparent version. Possibly several objects for GPU and CPU.
	* Example scripts: CUBA (simple), barrel cortex (complex - Kremer_et_al_2011)
	* Specific objects on GPU (GPUNeuronGroup, GPUConnection, etc)
		** Thresholding in GPUNeuronGroup ** (compaction) + threshold/reset
		* GPUConnection

[VDR]2) Synapses:
------------
Currently missing:
* nonlinear synapses (NMDA)
	-> using fake NeuronGroup as a proxy to synaptic weights + state updater
	issue: several synaptic variables
	using a slower clocks?
	(then we can define differential equations on synaptic weights)

* probabilistic synapses - implications for STP/STDP
	-> complicated! (is it very useful?)
* multiple synapses (with different delays) between the same pre/post neurons
	-> think of nice syntax
	
* STDP: access to postsynaptic variables
* STDP: rules with local synaptic variables
	-> event queues?
	-> example from STDP1/2

First, we should at least provide a way, even not clean and elegant, to implement
these things. Then essentially what will be needed is: 1) local synaptic variables
(distinct from weights), 2) event-driven synaptic dynamics (taking delays into
account).

3) Miscellaneous
----------------
[V]* Victor's spatialiser -> Brian Hears
	-> check final_examples
[D]* Refractoriness
	-> examples (syntax)
	-> BEP
[C]* Cyrille's new LinearStateUpdater code
	-> test
* Stochastic DE integrators
* Compound integrators (linear/nonlinear parts)
[D]* Multilinear state updater (new syntax for Equations)
	-> syntax: (constant)
[D]* Code generation
* Cluster simulations
	-> ask Eilif
	-> quick multicore test (CUBA?) to check if it's worth it
[B]* Cable equations (a lot is done, but we need to implement the integration method)
	-> try a HH axon (just Numpy)
[B]* Metrics in analysis (Bertrand)
	-> talk about syntax
* New SpikeGeneratorGroup

4) Examples and docs
--------------------
* More examples from our papers.
* Examples from papers should also be posted in modeldb.
* Examples using Playdoh.
* Electrode compensation example.
