BEP-1: Short term plasticity
Abstract: Implementation of short term plasticity following the Tsodyks-Markram
model.

The model: presynaptic spikes produce instantaneous changes in synaptic
variables, which also follow differential equations. The synaptic weight is
modulated by one of those variables, in a multiplicative way.

u*x is the modulation factor (in 0..1), weights are modulated by the value of
u*x before updating.

Implementation
==============
A number of variables are involved in the model. Since they are only modified
by presynaptic spikes, a group of the size of the presynaptic group P should be
created, with the appropriate dynamics. This group G receives spikes from P through
an IdentityConnection, which modify its variables. Spikes are directly forwarded
to the postsynaptic group Q, with a modulation. That connection should replace
the original connection between P and Q. This can be done simply by replacing
the source variable of the Connection.

To deal with delays correctly, the delays from P->Q should be transferred to
P->G and removed from P->Q, which might not be trivial. If those are not transferred,
then the delays are assumed to be purely dendritic.

The value of the modulation variable is only required at presynaptic spike times.
It implies that the integration of the equations can be event-driven, which would
minimize the simulation cost.

Interface
=========
A similar interface as for STDP should be chosen, e.g.:
stp=STP(C,parameters)
where C is the Connection.

One could pass the equations as a string as for STDP, but are there any other
models of synaptic dynamics being used?
