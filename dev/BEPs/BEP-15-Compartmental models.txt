BEP-15: Compartmental models

Abstract: I describe a way to implement compartmental models in Brian.

To model a neuron with a morphology, the standard approach is to divide the morphology in many
isopotential compartments, with currents flowing through the membrane or through the two sides of
the compartment. In the limit of infinitely many compartments, we obtain the cable equation.
If there any many compartments with the same equations (but possibly different parameter values),
then the same trick that applies for neuron groups applies for groups of compartments. The main difference
is that there is only 1 output spike. There are several possible designs:
* New NeuronGroup, indexes correspond to input synapses. In that case, each row of the state matrix
would be a (spatially distributed) variable, while columns would correspond to different compartments. A function
would map location ("LLR.15*um") to compartment index.
* A NeuronGroup with a new StateUpdater and relevant methods. Maybe N should be 1.

Description of a compartmental model
====================================
I feel that the notion of "compartment" should be mostly hidden because it is in fact an implementation detail
much as the choice of the timestep. Most models can be described by:
* currents that are spatially distributed (membrane currents)
* point currents (synapses and soma)
* morphology
* a few global parameters (axial resistance, etc)
* a threshold condition (and probably no reset), which is really a spike detection mechanism

The Connection object needs to address variables by their spatial location, in a single string
(although this might actually work with an object, with minor modifications to Connection and a few
other places). It involves changing the method get_var_index(state) in NeuronGroup, where state would
be for example "LLR.15*um.v" (branch left twice, branch right, advance 15 �m) or "LLR.end.v".
In the same way, state monitors need to address by spatial location for distributed variables
and also by name for point processes. Another possibility for names could be "v@LLR.15*um" or "v@mysynapse".
Those names are translated into indexes.

How to describe the spatial models? One possibility is to have a special term in the equation which would
correspond to the longitudinal current. This way we keep the spirit of Brian. For example:
eqs='''
dv/dt=(gl*(El-v)+Icable)/C : volt
'''
The term Icable would then be replaced by the adequate value by the updater. This is very easy to implement
internally, Icable just needs to be another variable. Alternatively, one could simply define the
membrane current:
eqs='''
Im=gl*(El-v) : amp/cm**2
'''
The NeuronGroup is then initialized with:
* spatial model equations (above)
* morphology (we need a new module here, maybe using the experimental one); the morphology is
a binary tree, except perhaps at the soma (e.g. 1 axon + 2 dendritic trees)
* global parameters
* point currents (possibly later), which could actually be non-spiking NeuronGroups.
* maybe somatic equations, possibly as point currents
* optionnally, threshold condition

One point we may want to think about is calcium dynamics: we should check whether
it can be incorporated in the same framework (Ca dynamics follows a sort of
cable equation).

Data structure
==============
I can imagine that there are at least two matrices:
* One for spatially distributed variables, each row of the state matrix
would be a (spatially distributed) variable, while columns would correspond to different compartments. A function
would map location ("LLR.15*um") to compartment index. This would be the standard state matrix.
* One or several for point processes, each row is a variable, columns index processes. Each such block could
actually by handled as a NeuronGroup (with spike input, possibly a Connection structure).

One also needs to find a simple way to set the distributed parameters, which could be the following:
neuron["LLR.15*um":"LLR.30*um"] would create a subgroup that corresponds to a branch of the neuron. Internally,
it is essentially a view on the relevant compartments. Then one could write things like
  branch=neuron["LLR.15*um":"LLR.30*um"]
  branch.gl=2*branch.gK
where the latter is a vector operation. Morphological parameters would be available as variables
(e.g. branch.diameter, branch.surface). The location of the compartment in the branch should also be indicated (branch.x),
but we have to decide whether it should be the relative or absolute location.
It could also be interesting if the branch was iterable:
for compartment in branch:
	compartment.gl=2*compartment.gK # this is in surfacic units

Point processes
===============
Synapses and electrodes are point processes, that is, not spatially distributed.
It makes sense to group synapses of the same type into a NeuronGroup. Thus, the neuron
stores a list of NeuronGroups for point processes, together with the indexes of compartments
where these point processes are inserted. The syntax could be as follows:

electrode="Iinj : amp"
neuron.dendrites.LR[5*um].insert(model=electrode,current="Iinj")

But this implies that the method checks whether there is already a group of processes
with the same model. Maybe dictionaries of models as strings and as
Equation objects. The problem is that we won't be able to use NeuronGroups at construction
time, which will cause some problems. Alternatively, we could have a state matrix
implemented as a dynamic array, or have it predeclared:

P=neuron.point_process(model=synapse,current="Iinj",N=10)
neuron.dendrites.LR[5*um].insert(P)

Internally, the model could be a Current (it could be passed as a string or Current object).

New attributes are created: neuron.Iinj is a vector with the value of Iinj for all
point processes. This is done by overriding the getattr/setattr methods and directing them
to the neuron groups that store the point processes.

Monitoring
==========
Special monitors need to be added to monitor distributed variables.
Without modification, the following should work, through the subgrouping mechanism:
M=StateMonitor(neuron.axon[50*um:100*um],'v',record=True)

It could be nice to have this syntax:
M=StateMonitor(neuron.axon,'v',record=[50*um:100*um])

and access recorded values in a similar way, e.g. M[60*um].

State update
============
1) Update point processes, as NeuronGroups
2) Update the spatial equation (e.g. using Hines method)
3) Add point currents

The state update for the cable equation can be done with Hines method:
Int J Biomed Comput. 1984 Jan-Feb;15(1):69-76.
Efficient computation of branched nerve equations.
Hines M.
Available on Neuron's website:
http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/nrnpubs

Another method here:
http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2157690.pdf
The Backward Euler Method for Numerical Solution of the Hodgkin-Huxley Equations of
Nerve Conduction.
Mascagni M. 1990

And:
Digital computer solutions for excitation and propagation of the nerve impulse.
Cooley & Dodge 1966

In this method, values of ionic currents are calculated at
midpoints of time steps as a function of V(t), and the
values of the conductances are considered as constant within
a timestep for the integration of the cable equation.
The cable equation uses a simple implicit scheme followed by
an explicit step. As I understand it, the update of Im (IHH in
the paper) and the integration of the cable equation are completely
independent. Therefore, we can have separate stateupdaters which are
called in the following order:
1) Update the spatial equation with Hines method.
2) Update the membrane current with a standard vectorized updater (2nd order?).
3) Update the point processes with a standard vectorized updater.

Neuron groups
=============
How to describe neuron groups with morphologies? Two options:
* neurons have the same morphology
* neurons have different morphologies, but the same models
It seems to me that option 2 is possible.
However the threshold mechanism must be changed.
It might also be possible to have gap junctions with this scheme.

Building the morphology
=======================
See experimental.morphology2. This should be a separate class, created before
the neuron is initialised.

mymorph=Morphology('pyramidalL5.swc')
mymorph=Morphology() # Creates a soma (1 compartment) or Soma()
mymorph.dendrites=Cylinder(l=100*um,d=2*um,n=20) # Inserts cylinder at soma, 20 compartments, subtree name "dendrites"
mymorph.dendrites.diameter=linspace(1*um,2*um,len(mymorph.dendrites))
for compartment in mymorph.dendrites: # maybe not very useful
    compartment.diameter=...
mymorph.dendrites.L=Cylinder(l=50*um,d=1*um,n=10) # Creates a child branch
mymorph.dendrites.R=Cylinder(l=50*um,d=1*um,n=10) # Creates another child branch
mymorph.dendrites.LL=Cylinder(l=50*um,d=1*um,n=10) # A short hand for L.L

Data structure
--------------
A neuron morphology is a tree of branches, and each branch is a list of segments.
The root is the soma.
Each segment has a diameter and length (except perhaps the soma).
The children can be named, but there are two special names "L" and "R" (left/right),
which allows concise access using binary strings of the form LLR
(left left right).
Additional information (which is in swc files) could be stored, e.g. 3D coordinates.

The data structure is a tree of branches. Each branch has the following attributes:
* diameter, length, area, x, y, z for all compartments (vectors)
* number of compartments (could be implicit in vector length)
* A dictionary of children, and possibly the parent.

Subgrouping
-----------
Ex: subtree=mymorph.dendrites.LLR
mymorph.dendrites returns a subtree, mymorph.dendrites.LLR too but it's a shorthand
for L.L.R. Internally, it does mymorph.dendrites.L.LR (recursive algorithm).

subtree=mymorph.dendrites[1131]
If it's not a binary tree, then we need to access children with numbers, this can be
done with setitem.

Insertion
---------
Ex: mymorph.dendrites.L=Cylinder(l=50*um,d=1*um,n=10) # or Branch?
Ex2: mymorph.dendrites.LLR=Cylinder(l=50*um,d=1*um,n=10)
using setattr. The instruction replaces or creates the subtree (child) with the given morphology.
LLR is shorthand for L.L.R (recursive algorithm as for subgrouping).
