BEP-9: Automatic code generation

Abstract:
	Brian should automatically generate code in various languages to
	optimise various operations. For example, nonlinear differential
	equations or string resets and thresholds are converted into
	Python code at the moment, but it should be possible to convert
	into C++ or GPU code as well. More ambitiously, a whole simulation
	might be converted into pure C++ code to totally eliminate the
	Python overhead.

Automatic code generation
=========================

There are two main things one might want to achieve with automatic
code generation. The simplest is just generation of code that is
executed from within Python, for example using weave.inline or
on a GPU. However, a more ambitious aim would be to generate C++
code that performed the entire simulation. This would involve having
C++ versions of most of Brian's objects, and a framework in which
they could be placed.

Work done so far
----------------

Automatic generation of Python code can be seen in several places in
Brian, particularly in the Equations object. This is fairly stable.

There are also some more experimental bits of code:

C++ code for Euler state update is done in brian.experimental.ccodegen.

GPU code for Euler state update is done in brian.experimental.gpucodegen.

GPU code for some standard Brian objects can be found in dev/ideas/cuda.

A framework for converting entire Brian simulations into pure C++ can
be found in dev/ideas/cppgen.

Worked example
--------------

Starting from the nonlinear differential equation::

    dV/dt = W*W/(100*ms) : 1
    dW/dt = -V/(100*ms) : 1

We generate the following Python code::

	V,W=P._S
	V__tmp,W__tmp=P._dS
	V__tmp[:]=W*W/(100*0.001)
	W__tmp[:]=-V/(100*0.001)
	P._S+=dt*P._dS

the following weave.inline code::

	double *V__Sbase = S+0*n;
	double *W__Sbase = S+1*n;
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
	    double &V = *V__Sbase++;
	    double &W = *W__Sbase++;
	    double V__tmp = W*W/(100*0.001);
	    double W__tmp = -V/(100*0.001);
	    V += dt*V__tmp;
	    W += dt*W__tmp;
	}

and the following GPU code::

	__global__ void stateupdate(double t, double *V, double *W)
	{
	    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
	    double V__tmp = W[i]*W[i]/(100*0.001);
	    double W__tmp = -V[i]/(100*0.001);
	    V[i] += 0.0001*V__tmp;
	    W[i] += 0.0001*W__tmp;
	}

The stages that are involved are:

1.  Freezing and optimising the expressions::

		V: W*W/(100*0.001)
		W: -V/(100*0.001)
	
	At the moment, not much in the way of optimising is done here,
	but for example you could obviously optimise 100*0.001 to 0.1.

2.  Specifying the solver code on a per-neuron basis, involving creating
    intermediate variables::
    
    	V__tmp defined by W*W/(100*0.001)
    	W__tmp defined by -V/(100*0.001)
    
    and then updating::
    
    	V += dt*V__tmp
    	W += dt*W__tmp
    
    For the Python code this final step is done in a manner vectorised over
    variables as well as neurons::
    
    	P._S += dt*P._dS

3.  Generating setup and loop code from the solver code in a way that is
    specific to the output being generated. So for example in Python we
    first load the variables into names::
    
		V, W = P._S
		V__tmp, W__tmp = P._dS
		
	Then we transform the intermediate variables by putting [:] in 
	front of them::
	
		V__tmp[:]=W*W/(100*0.001)
		W__tmp[:]=-V/(100*0.001)
	
	and finally we replace the update code with a vectorised version::
	
		P._S += dt*P._dS
    
    In C++ we first load the variables with pointers:: 
    
		double *V__Sbase = S+0*n;
		double *W__Sbase = S+1*n;
	
	Then we explicitly loop:
	
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
			...
		}
	
	We turn the variable names into references which increment the
	pointers::
	
	    double &V = *V__Sbase++;
	    double &W = *W__Sbase++;
	
	We create new intermediate variables from the expressions directly::
	
	    double V__tmp = W*W/(100*0.001);
	    double W__tmp = -V/(100*0.001);
	
	And because we used references for the variables names, updating
	can be done directly from the variables too::   
	 
	    V += dt*V__tmp;
	    W += dt*W__tmp;
    
    Finally, on the GPU we execute multiple threads which are passed
    a global variable specifying which neuron index they are working
    on:: 
    
		__global__ void stateupdate(double t, double *V, double *W)
		{
		    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
		    ...
	    }
	
	Then we proceed as for the C++ case except that rather than use
	a reference we use an explicit array access (although presumably
	a reference would work just as well)::
	
	    double V__tmp = W[i]*W[i]/(100*0.001);
	    double W__tmp = -V[i]/(100*0.001);
	    V[i] += 0.0001*V__tmp;
	    W[i] += 0.0001*W__tmp;

Refactoring
-----------

Refactoring the code above would be straightforward, you have:

1. A function for freezing and optimising an expression.
2. Specification of solver code, including intermediate variables
   and final update.
3. Transformation of expressions into target language, which can
   involve expression rewriting (e.g. x**y -> pow(x,y)).

There are some issues here, for example the optimal Python update
at the end is::

	P._S += dt*P._dS

and not::

	V += dt*V__tmp
	W += dt*W__tmp

In addition, the expression rewriting is not straightforward to do
(but can work in many cases probably).

Issues
------

In the above we've only considered the Euler update, but different
solvers (in particular the implicit solver) may have more complicated
schemes which might involve pre and post processing of the data, and
we may also want to think about mixed exact linear state updaters with
inexact nonlinear state updaters, etc. So can this all be specified
in one scheme? Need to do a survey of the existing state updaters
to determine this.

In addition, there are also string thresholds and resets, various
custom operations, etc. Ideally the code generators should be able
to handle as much of this as possible in the easiest way possible.
There should probably also be a fallback mechanism, whereby people can
provide their own translated code if they wish, which can be used
alongside other generated code. This would be useful for example if
there were more or less optimal ways to do things in different
languages or if our automatic translators failed or weren't defined for
a particular case (e.g. custom operation).

Proposal
========

A scheme should be defined for specifying per-neuron updates using
expressions and potentially intermediate variables. For example
using the template matching from the Python string module a
specification of the Euler update might be::

	intermediate:
		$vartype ${var}__tmp = $var_expr
	update:
		$var += ${var}__tmp

This is only a suggestion of a scheme, the precise scheme used should
be based on a survey of the current solvers, string thresholds/resets
and so on.

In addition, some sort of scheme for dealing with more complicated
solvers? Or just special casing these? What about mixed linear/nonlinear
for example?

Some other possible schemes for Euler update::

	@foreachneuron
		@foreachvar: $all_vars
			@intermediate: ${var}__tmp
				$var_expr
		@foreachvar: $all_vars
			$var += ${var}__tmp

This latter is uglier, but maybe makes it more flexible and allows for
better optimisation for target languages. It may also be possible to
combine this more easily with things like mixed linear and nonlinear
state updates. One might imagine for example something like this::

	@exactlinear: $linear_vars
	@$nonlinear_scheme: $nonlinear_vars
	
Is this level of complexity justified though?
