BEP-13: The Brian console
Abstract:
    The Brian console allows access to objects from a running Brian script, such as
    groups, connections and monitors. Two independent applications can be made:
    1) a text console, possibly based on an existing interpreter (e.g. ipython);
    2) a graphical interface, which would also allow online visualisation. The Brian
    console could also be used to control the simulation.

Communication with the Brian script
===================================
The communication server in the Brian script could be implemented simply as
a network operation (called, say, every second), which would have access
to a running Network object. The client would be an independent application, which
would send Python commands and obtain information about objects in the Brian script,
while the simulation is still running. Commands (start/stop/save/resume) could also
be sent.

Graphical interface
===================
The server sends the list of objects in the Network to the client. That list is then
displayed (possibly with names, if they exist). The user can pick variables to monitor
them.
Online imaging could even be done using monitors (e.g. a monitor is added to the network
and reset every second).

Online visualisation
====================
* Oscilloscope: traces of a variable are monitored.
* Imaging: variables or spikes are displayed in real time with color coding.
* Connectivity: fibers with varying thickness (3D?) represent the synaptic weights.
Dendrites and/or axon from a specific neuron can be selected.

Implementation
==============
We could use for example Pyro for the communications.
