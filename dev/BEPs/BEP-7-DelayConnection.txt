BEP-7: DelayConnection
Abstract: Connections with heterogeneous delays

Introduction
============

Want a Connection object that can handle neurons with delays
that vary either per neuron or per synapse.

Issues
======

Functionality
-------------

There is a difference between presynaptic and postsynaptic delays.
Do we want to include both? How important is that compared to
implementation decisions (see below)?

Syntax
------

Instantiation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current syntax for the instantiation of the DelayConnection
class is the same as for the Connection class with one extra
keyword delay_dimension=1 or delay_dimension=2 (for per-neuron
or per-synapse delays). This keyword could easily be renamed,
e.g.:

* synaptic_delays=True would correspond to delay_dimension=2
  and would be the default, and synaptic_delays=False would
  correspond to delay_dimension=1.
* neuronal_delays=False would correspond to delay_dimension=2
  and would be the default, and neurons_delays=True for dim 1.

A related issue would be whether or not we want the user to have
to use DelayConnection or whether we could just add keywords to
Connection, and that if those keywords were present the Connection
class would just make itself into a DelayConnection class.

Referring to delays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More problematic is what should be done about defining connections.
The current implementation stores two matrices, one for the delays
and one for the weights. The matrices have the same type. These
are currently accessed through a ``delays`` property, i.e.::

	C.delays[i,j] = ...

There are some technical issues about how you make sure that the
weight matrix and the delay matrix have exactly the same structure,
see below.

Initialising delays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the moment, there are no helper functions like ``connect_random``
and ``connect_full`` that do anything for delays. You have to just
initialise these by hand. Some proposals:

* Implement a ``initialise_random_delay`` function and/or a
  ``initialise_delay`` function that takes a function ``f(i,j)``
  as an argument. This would then be evaluated for every nonzero
  entry in the weight matrix (so that initialisation of the
  weight matrix would have to come before initialisation of the
  delay matrix).
* Override the ``connect_random`` functions to include extra
  keywords like ``delays=...``. For example, you could have
  ``delays=(min,max)``, ``delays=func``, etc.

Implementation
==============

Propagation
~~~~~~~~~~~

The current implementation of DelayConnection is postsynaptic. An
array is stored which is NxM where N is the number of target
neurons, and M is the number of time steps for the maximum delay,
i.e. maxdelay/dt. This array is circular in time and has a current
index pointer. When a spike arrives it is propagated to the
appropriate row of the array, and when the current index pointer
reaches a row the cumulative effects of that row are propagated
to the target neurons. This implementation is reasonably efficient
and can work with both per-neuron and per-synapse delays easily,
and can handle dense and sparse matrices easily.

Delays are stored either as a vector or a second array of the same
type and shape as the weight matrix. Delays are stored as floats
and converted to ints on the fly (so that delays can be easily
changed at runtime).

Keeping delays and weights in sync
----------------------------------

For sparse matrices they should have the same nonzero entries
and this should be enforced somehow. The current implementation at
compression time first compresses the weight matrix, duplicates
that structure and copies the delay values from the construction
matrix to the weight matrix. If a delay value is missing from the
construction matrix it is set to 0, if a weight value corresponding
to an entry in the sparse matrix is missing, it is ignored. After
compression, it is at the moment up to the user to keep these in
sync.
