BEP-10: Error handling

Abstract: Errors raised by Brian scripts are often hard to understand because
the error is typically raised in a subroutine of a Brian module that the user
doesn't know about. The idea would be to have clearer error messages and error
catching mechanisms that would relate the error and its context to the Brian
script.

I am just listing a few ideas here.

Defining a new exception BrianError and subclasses
==================================================
For example, we could imagine that each major class would have
its exception type, and the exception would be called with
the instance of the class (self) and other runtime information.

A separate module could gather a number of functions to make the
message nicer and to do some introspection into the traceback,
the frames and the user script (using the get_source function from the
inspect module).
These could be methods of a base Exception class BrianError.

[Dan adds: agreed, seems like a good idea.]

Nested exceptions
=================
In many cases, the function that raises the exception does not know
the context, such as the user-defined differential equations, etc.
One could imagine to use a specific exception to pass information
to the calling function, e.g.:

def a_specific_method(self):
	...
	raise SpecificException(self,other_information)
	
def global_function():
	try:
		eqs.a_specific_method()
	except SpecificException as e:
		useful_info=e.other_information
		raise WhatEverError("I got one!",useful_info)
		# or WhatEverError(e,...)

[Dan adds: we had this in the past, or something very similar, and
it didn't work very well, it basically made it more difficult to
understand what was going on. We should have something like this,
but only in those cases where an explicit error catching mechanism
fails I think. Rather than improve the error reporting (which is
what this tries to do), it would be much better to improve Brian's
code so that it understands errors and deals with them more
appropriately. At the moment we basically just hope there won't be
any...
Romain: yes I didn't mean something like the bug handler,
"global-function" here does not embed the simulation, it could just be
any method. There is at least one example currently where the
units mismatch error is caught by the Equations object which
changes it into a message about the differential equations
being non-homogeneous]

Real cases
==========
We should list here a number of real cases that we would like to handle.

1.
   times  = property(fget=lambda self:QuantityArray(self._times))
   AttributeError: 'StateMonitor' object has no attribute '_times'

Most likely: the statemonitor was initialised without setting the
record keyword.
