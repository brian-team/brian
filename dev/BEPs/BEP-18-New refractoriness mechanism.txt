BEP-18: New refractoriness mechanism

Introduction
------------
It seems to me that the current mechanisms for resets and refractoriness is a
bit ad-hoc - and only really works nicely for the simple case of a fixed
refractory period for all neurons, with relatively simple (not custom) resets.

Background
----------
The original mechanism worked by replacing the Reset class with a
Refractoriness class that instead of using the list of neurons that had just
spiked, uses the list of neurons that have spiked in the last T time steps. This
has two problems, first of all it was still just a reset, so because
thresholding and propagation happen before resetting, strong inputs could cause
a spike during the refractory period (and this did happen). We fixed this by
adding an additional mechanism that, after thresholding, checks if a neuron is
in its refractory period, and removes it from the list of spikes if it is. This
solves the problem, but is a little ad hoc. The second problem with the original
mechanism is that it doesn't work well for custom resets. This meant we had to
write several additional custom refractoriness classes. These are
SimpleCustomRefractoriness and CustomRefractoriness. The first of these takes a
Python function, a refractory period, and a state variable as arguments. When
the neuron spikes, it saves the value of the specified state variable after the
Python function is called, and then holds it at that value for the refractory
period. The second, CustomRefractoriness, takes two functions, a reset function
and a refractory function, and a refractory period. Initially the reset function
is called, and then for the duration of the refractory period, the refractory
function is called on the list of indices of neurons that are in their
refractory states.

This system is now reasonably general, but it misses several features. First of
all, it doesn't play nicely with things like string resets because it requires
you specify a Python function. Secondly, there was no support for variable
refractoriness until recently, and there's only a rather simple form of support
for it even now (only with a simple reset).

Proposal
--------
First of all, we do away with having refractoriness be a special case of
resetting. We'll now have separate reset and refractoriness classes that
function in different ways. What happens is that each time step, the reset
class is called on the list of neurons that have just spiked. If the
refractoriness class has a 'start' method (for example), it also gets called
with this list. Finally, the NeuronGroup object handles variable refractoriness,
and has a new method get_refractory_indices() as well as the older get_spikes(),
and the refractoriness classes will use this method.

The most important refractoriness class, possibly the base class for the others,
would just hold a set of variables at their values after the reset, so you might
specify reset='V=Vr; Vt+=deltaVt' and refractory=Clamp('V', 5*ms). (See below
for some ideas on syntax.)

In the scheme I'm proposing then, the absolute refractoriness is handled in a
special case way by NeuronGroup itself, and the clamping of variables is handled
separately by refractoriness classes. Another possibility would be to have the
absolute refractoriness handled by the refractoriness class, we could have a
base class that just handles this, as well as base class that handles clamping,
and these could be combined into a class that derives from both of them to get
both behaviours (for example). That's conceptually nice from a programming point
of view, but maybe not so nice for the user?

Variable refractoriness
-----------------------
Another matter that requires some thought is how variable refractoriness should
work. At the moment, in the simplest case of a simple reset, you can have fixed
refractoriness, a fixed refractoriness array, or specify a variable of the
equations that gives the refractory time. In this latter case, you also have to
provide a max_refractory argument (but this wouldn't be necessary if we used the
mechanism I described above because you don't need to remember spike times).

Technical note: the way NeuronGroup handles refractoriness at the moment is to
store an array _next_allowed_spiketime of length the number of neurons in the
group, which tells it the next time that the neurons are allowed to fire a
spike. After a spike, this array is incremented for each spiking neuron by its
refractory period. To get the list of indices of neurons that are currently
refractory then you just have to do _next_allowed_spiketime>t.

Syntax
------
There's also the syntax to be considered, and it's a slightly tricky problem. At
the moment, the user writes things like reset=-60*mV and refractory=5*ms, and
that works OK, but if they want more complicated things they have to specify a
refractoriness class for the reset.

Here's a possibility. We always use variable refractoriness, and we introduce a
forced state variable 'refractory' to give the refractory periods. If the user
specifies refractory in their equations, then we do nothing, otherwise we add it
to their equations as a parameter. So if they wanted, they could have a
differential equation governing refractoriness.

Simple cases:

reset=value (implied variable V, v, Vm, vm)
  refractory=value or array
     clamps the implied variable to its value after reset
reset='var=val'
  as above, but use the reset state variable instead of implied var
reset=string, function, class
  refractory=value or array
     clamps the implied variable V, v, Vm, vm at given period

In more complex cases, you need to specify two bits of information for the
refractoriness, the variables/code for the refractoriness, and the refractory
period. In fact, the latter is sort of optional, because you can specify the
periods afterwards by changing the 'refractory' state variable. I would suggest
we introduce a new keyword for this case. The 'refractory' keyword has always
referred to a length of time in the past, and I think logically it's nice to
keep it that way rather than have it mean several different things. The new
keyword could be something like 'refractoriness' or 'refractorycode' or
'refractorytype'. Depending on its type, it would mean one of:

state variable or tuple of state variables: clamp
string, function, class: custom code

Some examples with this syntax:

G = NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset=Vr, refractory=5*ms)
G = NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset=Vr, refractory=5*ms*rand(N))
G = NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset='x=x0', refractory=5*ms)
G = NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset='V=Vr; Vt+=deltaVt', refractory=5*ms)
G = NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset='x=x0; y+=deltay', refractory=5*ms, refractoriness='x')
G = NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset='x=x0; y+=deltay', refractory=5*ms, refractoriness='x=x0')

The 'refractory' keyword would be strictly optional, as you could always do
something like this afterwards anyway:

G.refractory = 5*ms
G.refractory = 5*ms*rand(N)

Well, that's one proposal for the syntax, I can think of several others. For
example, you could keep only a 'refractory' keyword, but allow tuples like 
refractory=('x', 5*ms) to mean clamp variable 'x' for 5*ms, or
refractory=('x', 'y', 5*ms*rand(N)) to mean clamp variables 'x' and 'y' for
5*ms*rand(N), or refractory=('x=x0', 5*ms). My feeling is that this probably
ends up being more confusing in the long run though. 

Romain's proposal
-----------------
[from briansupport]
Maybe one way to see the problem is that we are trying to specify
spiking models (=hybrid systems) with two states, active and refractory.
Each of these two states may be defined by a separate set of
differential equations, and transitions are defined by conditions
(=threshold) and discrete operations (=reset). In other words,
refractoriness could be defined in exactly the same way as a standard
model, with equations, threshold and reset. We could provide a special
variable, "lastspike" or something like that, which would store the time
of the last spike (i.e., last transition active->refractory).

Here is how Dan's examples could be done in this way (keyword names are
not great):

> G = NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset=Vr, refractory=5*ms)

G=NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset=Vr, refractory_eqs='dv/dt=0*volt/second :
volt', refractory_threshold='t>lastspike+5*ms')

or without clamping v:

G=NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset=Vr, threshold='(v>Vt) & (t>lastspike+5*ms)')

> G = NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset=Vr, refractory=5*ms*rand(N))

G=NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset='v=Vr;refractory=5*ms*rand(N)',
refractory_eqs='dv/dt=0*volt/second : volt',
refractory_threshold='t>lastspike+refractory')

and eqs contain the line "refractory : second".

> G = NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset='x=x0', refractory=5*ms)
> G = NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset='V=Vr; Vt+=deltaVt', refractory=5*ms)
> G = NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset='x=x0; y+=deltay', refractory=5*ms,
> refractoriness='x')
> G = NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset='x=x0; y+=deltay', refractory=5*ms,
> refractoriness='x=x0')

All these can be done exactly in the same way, e.g.:
G=NeuronGroup(N, eqs, reset='x=x0; y+=deltay',
refractory_eqs='dx/dt=0*volt/second : volt',
refractory_threshold='t>lastspike+5*ms')

Keywords are not great (maybe refractory_end instead of
refractory_threshold? and perhaps simply "refractory" instead of
"refractory_eqs"?).

The variables for the refractory state should be the same as for the
active state, since it's the same neuron. So I suggest that
1) all variables must be defined in the model equations (eqs) (possibly
as parameters),
2) by default, unspecified variables in the refractory equations have
the same dynamics as in the active state.

For the implementation:
* At construction time, we make a stateupdater, a threshold and a reset
for the refractory state, almost exactly as for the active state. These
must modified so that "lastspike" contains the time of the last spike time.
* We add an extra boolean array in each group, which says which neurons
are active or refractory (.refractory?).
* At run time, we apply each state updater, threshold and reset to their
corresponding subgroup. It's almost as if we had 2 groups instead of 1,
except the partition is dynamic.

It is not very different from Dan's proposition, but I think it's
conceptually simpler and therefore might be easier to use/understand.
It's also slightly more general as you can have differential equations
during the refractory state. I think having code called during
refractoriness is not very elegant, because it means artifically
introducing clock-based events. 

Syntax
------
There are two states, active and refractory. So we need:
* equations for active state (A)
* equations for refractory state (R) (unspecified = same as active)
* transition A->R (threshold and reset)
* transition R->A (threshold and reset)
Spikes are produced at the A->R transition. In the namespace, one variable
stores the time of the last spike (lastspike?).

I'm not sure the two sets of equations should be in the same string, because
they need to be turned into Equation objects. Or, it should be possible
to pass the two sets separately (possibly as Equation objects).

Example:
'''
active:
dv/dt=-v/tau : volt

refractory:
dv/dt=0 # should the units be specified?
'''

or:
model='...', refractory='...'

How to set the transitions?
We already have the reset and threshold keywords for the A->R transition.
We probably don't really need a reset for the R->A transition (right?).
We need a keyword for the transition from refractory to active.
