BEP-17: Vectorised STDP
Abstract: Synaptic plasticity and learning act on a slow timescale. In many
cases, the network is presented with many stimuli (e.g. sounds) sequentially.
I propose to present the stimuli in parallel, and either have a shared connection
matrix or regularly collect the weight changes.

One simple idea
---------------
* Create a big group.
* Divide in subgroups P[i].
* Create connections between subgroups, but change C.W to refer to those of
  layer 0 (subgroup P[0]). It should be done after the connection is compressed.
* Define STDP in each layer.

Here we probably only save computation time on the state update.
A better way would be to have a single Connection and STDP object rather than
one per layer, but the difficulty is to have a shared connection matrix.
I think it could work, except when two different layers want to change the
same synaptic weight at the same time, which would happen any time two
corresponding neurons fire simultaneously in different layers. Maybe this
case could be treated explicitly since it should not happen so often.

In summary, what is needed is essentially a new connection matrix structure
which implements duplicates over layers.
For example, W[i].data would return W0[i].repeat(M)
and W[i].target would be precomputed.
