BEP-5: Integral to differential
Abstract: This BEP proposes a function to find the linear differential system
associated to a given impulse response (e.g. PSPs, PSCs, STDP rules...).

Example: g(t)=t*exp(-t/tau)
should be converted to:
dg/dt=(x-g)/tau
dx/dt=-x/tau
with appropriate scaling, and the initial condition x=1,g=0 at time t=0.

Idea: use the automatic differentiation to calculate d^ng/dt^n and calculate the rank
of a set of vectors g^{(n)}(t_i) to find the dimension. Then use e.g. least square
minimization to find the matrix.
Issue: this does not work if there are free variables (e.g. tau).

Implementation proposal:
eqs=equations("g(t)=t*exp(-t/tau)") # returns Equations or string object
# I couldn't find a proper name for the function!

The differential system contains variables g and g_in and is such that the solution
with initial condition g_in=1 and x=0 for all other variables is such that g(t) matches
the given expression.
How to do it:
* A duration T is passed (typically a few times tau)
* re matching to extract g, t (time variable) and the RHS expression
* conversion to a function of t
* nth-derivatives of g are calculated with automatic differentiation
* N points are randomly drawn in [0,T] and N vectors are calculated, each vector
holds the value of g^{(i)}(t_j).
* The rank is calculated as follows: calculate the best LSQ approximation of g{(n)} as
a function of g^i (i<n). When the residual error does not change significantly from n to n+1, 
then the rank is n.
* A matrix A has been found such that dX/dt=AX, where x_0=g and x_i=g^{(i)}. In fact
the matrix is such that for i<n-1, a_ii+1=1 and a_ij=0 otherwise. The last row comes from
the LSQ calculation.
* Now a change of variables must be done so that variable x_0 is unchanged and the solution
matches the initial condition problem [TO FINISH].
