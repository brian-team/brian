BEP-23-Event-driven code generation.txt

Abstract: For the Synapses class (see BEP-21), we need to be able to turn
differential equations into event-driven update code. This BEP describes
how it can be done.

Example
=======
This is the Synapses code for STP:

S=Synapses(source,target,
           model='''dx/dt=(1-x)/taud : 1
                    du/dt=(U-u)/tauf : 1
                    w : 1''',
           pre='''v=v+w*u*x
                  x=x*(1-u)
                  u=u+U*(1-u)
                  ''') # STP

We want to turn it into this:

S=Synapses(source,target,
           model='''x : 1
                    u : 1
                    w : 1''',
           pre='''u=U+(u-U)*exp((t-lastspike)/tauf)
                  x=1+(x-1)*exp((t-lastspike)/taud)
                  v=v+w*u*x
                  x*=(1-u)
                  u+=U*(1-u)                  
                  ''') # Event-driven STP

Ideas
=====
I can see two ways to do this:
1) Use Sympy do symbolically solve the equations at construction time, and rewrite
   the pre/post code.
2) Calculate the matrix form of the equations: dX/dt=A*X+B, and then use the
   matrix exponential at update time.

The second idea is simpler because we already have all the code to do it, it's
essentially the same as the LinearStateUpdater for NeuronGroup.
But in the long run, the first idea might make things simpler (plus we may be
able to treat more cases), and directly usable for C/GPU code generation.

Subtleties
==========
There are several subtleties:
* Sometimes we need to keep to continuous updates. This is the case if there
  is a lumped variable (e.g. gtot=sum of g for all synapses).
* If only part of the equations can be turned into event-driven code, then we
  need to make sure that the other variables are independent, otherwise we will
  have to keep continuous updates for all dependent variables.
