BEP-22: Brian Hears on GPU
Abstract: Brian Hears should be updated to run on the GPU without transferring
data to/from the CPU frequently to remove the data transfer bottleneck.

Issues
======

* Final operation should be seemless, the user shouldn't need to have to do
  anything except install PyCUDA.
* GPU operations should be extensible, i.e. the user can provide GPU code to
  avoid reintroducing a CPU<->GPU bottleneck
* Output data should be allowed to connect straightforwardly with Brian, this
  could be just via GPUNeuronGroup possibly. However, that means implementing
  reset/threshold on GPU.

Avoiding the bottleneck
-----------------------

The simplest way to avoid the GPU/CPU bottleneck would be to allow data to stay
in the global memory of the GPU. This could be achieved by adding a keyword
argument to buffer_fetch, say allow_gpu. This would make everything transparent
to implement and allow for mixed GPU/CPU operation and backwards compatibility.

However, in chains of filterbanks it may not be efficient, because it involves
a read/write to global memory for each filterbank in the chain, and this gives
us a global memory bottleneck.

A more complicated solution would be to allow the automatic merging of
compatible filterbanks to avoid read/writes to global memory. There are
several possible ways to do this, each involving a merged kernel. One
possibility is to work sample by sample, that is we write a per-sample operation
and combine the loops together. So, for example if we combined say, a
LinearFilterbank with a FunctionFilterbank to half-wave rectify and compress
we might have something like this for the LinearFilterbank:

	__global__ void filt(SCALAR *_b, SCALAR *_a, SCALAR *_x, SCALAR *_zi,
	                     SCALAR *_y, int numsamples)
	{
	    int j = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
	    if(j>=n) return;
	    for(int s=0; s<numsamples; s++)
	    {
	       // linear filterbank update code here
		}
	}

We don't currently have a FunctionFilterbank on GPU, and in fact it's
non-trivial to turn it into code that can run on GPU, particularly if it uses
lambda functions whose (string) code can't be inspected. (A way to address this
is to use symbolic variables, e.g. using sympy, and apply the lambda function
to them - doesn't work in every case but probably would in many cases. This
could be combined with code generation, see more on that below.) However, the
C++ representation of the operation would be something like:

	x = (x>0)*x;
	x = fpow(x, 1.0/3.0);
	
So, the sample-by-sample approach would be to have a template:

	__global__ void filt(int numsamples, SCALAR *x,
	                     %(ARGUMENT_DECLARATIONS)
	                     )
	{
	    int j = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
	    if(j>=n) return;
	    %(FILTER_INIT_CODE)
	    for(int s=0; s<numsamples; s++)
	    {
	       %(FILTER_SAMPLE_CODE)
		}
		%(FILTER_END_CODE)
	}

The %(...) syntax can be used to insert the specific code for each filter, one
after the other. This is the same approach used by GPUModelfitting. This
approach makes it relatively straightforward for users to supply their own
code if it works sample-by-sample. If the code is necessarily buffered, for
example a buffered correlator or something like that, it may be more 
complicated.

With this approach you might end up with things like:

	fb = FunctionFilterbank(source, lambda x: x*x)
	
Using the sympy symbolic codegen approach this could be easily converted to:

	x = x*x;
	
for use on the GPU. In more complicated cases where sympy failed, you could
provide your own GPU code, e.g.:

	fb = FunctionFilterbank(source, lambda x: clip(x, 0, Inf)**(1.0/3.0),
	                        gpu_code='''
	                        x = (x>0)*x;
	                        x = fpow(x, 1.0/3.0);
	                        ''')

For maximum flexibility, all approaches could be implemented, i.e. combining
kernels either sample-by-sample or in terms of buffers; and allowing
buffer_fetch to return either CPU or GPU data (if a switch is provided). The
more efficient methods would be preferred if they existed, but otherwise not.

Another major issue is how to handle filterbanks which change the number of
channels, and ones which have multiple inputs/outputs. In these cases, kernel
combining may be impossible, and we may have to use writes to global memory.
However, optimisations that use kernel combination may be possible in some
cases. I imagine what we will need to do is have some sort of graph analyser
that generates a graph of the filters and selects the approach according to
the topology.

Issues:

* Providing code that is not sample-by-sample but works on buffers
* Handling filters with different min/max buffer sizes
* Using shared memory for code that works on buffers? How to do it?
* Syntax for users to provide code
* Method for passing arguments to the filt function, e.g. specifying a
  namespace along with the code.
* FFT based filtering on the GPU?
* How to handle filters which change the number of channels on the GPU? e.g.
  Interleave, etc.
* How to handle filters with multiple inputs/outputs
* How to handle feedback

Code generation
---------------

Mostly, complicated code generation issues can be ignored for Brian Hears,
however there are a few cases where it might be relevant.

Filter code may require access to variables, and the way to do this is probably
to provide a namespace for the code. This is the approach I'm planning for the
code generation generally. So it might be worth outlining the approach here
briefly:

The idea is to have a Code object, or something like it, which has two major
properties, a code string, or compiled code object, and a namespace. The code
can be in several different languages (Python, CPU C, GPU C, etc.). In Python,
it is simply a case of doing:

	exec code_str in namespace
	
In C on CPU it would be:

	weave.inline(code_str, local_dict=namespace)
	
And on GPU it would be more complicated because you would need to parse the
namespace into an argument list and then pass this to the kernel function, etc.

Code objects may also be combined, for example you might want to do a bit of
initialisation in Python before running the main code in C, so the Code object
should have some way of allowing combinations, shared namespaces, etc.

That's a brief outline of how I see the code generation stuff working, and it
might be good to use this for Brian Hears. Maybe just implementing a design for
the approach above would be a good start, without worrying about the more
complicated issues of generating the code strings themselves.

The other code generation issue is the generation of code from user specified
functions. One way to do this is to inspect the function source code, which
might be possible in some cases. For lambda functions, the approach I mentioned
before of using sympy Symbol objects might be possible. In other cases, we
might just have to force the user to specify the code explicitly.

Plan
====

This is a first draft of the implementation plan:

(1) Write a very simple code generation module as described above, that only
    handles the framework, i.e. the Code object. I'll do this (Dan).

(2) Design a framework that is able to handle all the problems described above
    (e.g. different numbers of channels, multiple inputs/outputs). This
    framework should allow for the possibility of optimisations, but doesn't
    necessarily have to include an implementation. At this stage, the design
    should be not too detailed.
    
(3) Go through all of the filterbanks that we know about, and all the examples
    we have and see if the framework could handle them. If not, redesign and
    iterate (2-3).
    
(4) Implement the design, starting with the simplest cases such as linear
    filterbank chains and then moving on to the more complicated cases.
    
(5) Performance testing.
    
(6) Implement the code generation stuff for users to write extended filters,
    or filters with feedback.
    
(7) More performance testing.

Separate to this, we need to implement GPU reset/threshold, and this can be
folded into GPUNeuronGroup when it is done.

Framework
=========

Very sketchy ideas:

* Use Code object as in code generation
* Generate a filterbank graph and analyser
* Add a gpu=True/False flag to buffer_fetch
* Use per-sample and per-buffer kernel combination via templates
