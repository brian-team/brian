Using Brian with Picloud
========================

Install the Picloud client
--------------------------

* Download the following file :
	https://media.picloud.com/downloads/cloud/1.9/cloud-1.9-py2.6.egg

* Open a console in the same folder where the file was downloaded, and run the
  command :
  	easy_install cloud-1.9-py2.6.egg

Test Script
-----------

* Run the script 'test.py' and wait a few seconds for the jobs to be finished !

Test Brian Script
-----------------

* Run the script 'briantest.py' and wait about 3 minutes for the 32 jobs to be finished !

Using Picloud
-------------

* Copy 'multimap.py' and 'keys.py' into your working directory.

* To use Picloud by calling a single function with multiple arguments in parallel,
  first write your function with a single argument (you can have global variables defined
  in the script that are used in the function) :
    
    from multimap import *
    def fun(x):
        # do something
        return y
            
  Your function can do network simulations with Brian, but you can't use any plotting functions.
            
* Define the list of arguments :

    args = [arg1, arg2, arg3, ...]

* Launch the jobs in the cloud with the 'multimap' function :

    jids = multimap(fun, args)
    
* After a few seconds, jids contains the list of the job indices (one job = one argument). The machines in the cloud
  are now running your functions, so this may take a while. You can shutdown your computer, the jobs will still be running.

* To retrieve the results, call the 'retrieve' function :

    results = retrieve(jids)

  This line will complete only when all jobs have completed. Finally, 'results' is the list of the results
  for all the arguments.
