Ideas for automatic C++ code generation
---------------------------------------

- To start with, you still initialise the code with Python, but
  if certain conditions are met then the run statement can be
  converted into pure C++ code (if all of the operations
  in the schedule have C++ versions).

Could start by implementing:

- LinearStateUpdater
- Threshold, produces spike list
- Reset and Refractoriness, takes argument spike list
- Propagate
- SpikeMonitor/StateMonitor

Ideas for framework:

- generate large inline C++ file and run it with weave.inline,
  have a set of standard classes which can be included. I
  think you can specify 'support' header files in weave, but
  I'm not sure if it can dynamically use code that is already
  compiled.

- use SWIG, have a standard data structure for Network and
  just pass data to it. This is nice because code only has
  to be compiled once, and for Windows distributions the
  user wouldn't even have to do that.
  
I would tend towards the SWIG option to start with.
