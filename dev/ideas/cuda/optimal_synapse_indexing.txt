Optimal partitioning of synapses
================================
How to optimize the indexing of synapses such as to minimize the number of block accesses in both
the forward and backward direction?

Each block contains 32 synapses. When a spike is produced, it will reach synapses at various
delays. Operations are executed on the synapses after these delays. Therefore there will be
simultaneous operations for all synapses that have the same presynaptic neuron and presynaptic
delay. The same holds for the backward propagation problem.

Mathematically, we have two partitions of the synapse indexes. To each index corresponds a block.
We want to renumber the indexes (permutation) so as to minimize the number of blocks in each set of
both partitions.

Alternative view (Marcel's idea)
--------------------------------
The blocks are a partition of the set of synapses in fixed size groups (32 elements).
We define a graph by putting an edge between any two synapses that are simultaneously accessed,
either in the forward or backward direction.
We then look for the partition that minimizes the number of graph cuts.
This is a classical graph theory problem:

There is Python package, PyMetis:

This is based on Metis, which uses these algorithms:

Distributed Computing, 48(1):96–129, 1998.

Maybe somebody wrote GPU algorithms too?

-----
A cut in the partition corresponds to two synapses belonging to different blocks that are accessed simultaneously,
either in the forward or backward way.

Consider a forward group of n synapses separated into M blocks (a set of simultaneously accessed synapses).
The associated cost is M block accesses. To each synapse in a block of p synapses corresponds n-p cuts.
Therefore the total number of cuts is: n^2-sum(p_i^2), where p_i is the number of synapses in block i
(with n=sum(p_i)). This is equal to sum(p_i*p_j, i!=j) (for what it's worth).

Therefore, in the graph cut view, we maximize: sum(p_i^2). If we assume that all blocks have roughly the same
size (which is likely to be false), this means p_i=n/M, so sum(p_i^2)=n^2/M.
In this case, the graph cut algorithm maximizes: sum(n_k^2/M_k), where M_k is the number of blocks in each group.
Assuming again homogeneity, this is equivalent to minimizing the number of blocks represented in each group.
