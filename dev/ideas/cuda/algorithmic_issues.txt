Algorithmic issues
==================
NeuronGroup
-----------
The main issue is compaction.

Synapses
--------
The main issue is probably coalescence.
Consider two connected groups of neurons P and Q, with p synapses per neuron on average.
I also consider the most interesting case, when there is STDP and heterogeneous delays.

Forward propagation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let us first consider forward propagation with various conduction delays.
When a spike is produced by presynaptic neuron i, the spike reaches p synaptic targets,
at different times. These spikes will then affect synaptic variables, and/or postsynaptic
variables.

We consider that these variables are instantly modified (i.e., no buffering).
In particular, synaptic weight is modified by each incoming spike.
At any given time step, we have to consider a set of incoming spikes from different neurons.
Assuming that different neurons fire independently, variables
corresponding to different presynaptic neurons must be considered as non
contiguous (in the sense that contiguity can only occur by chance).
Therefore, it is enough to examine the case of spikes coming from a single
presynaptic neuron. Synapses activated with different delays will not be processed at the
same time, and therefore can also be considered as non-contiguous (in the sense that
they will always imply multiple memory accesses). Therefore, synapses that may be
considered as contiguous are only those with the same presynaptic neuron and delay.
In summary, optimizing global memory accesses means optimizing the contiguity of
synaptic variables corresponding the same presynaptic neuron and delay, i.e.,
minimizing the number of memory blocks occupied by a given presynaptic neuron and delay.

Backward propagation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the most general setting, the same reasoning applies to backward propagation.
This means simultaneously:
* minimizing the number of memory blocks occupied by a given presynaptic neuron and delay.
* minimizing the number of memory blocks occupied by a given postsynaptic neuron and backward delay.

However, in most practical cases, the backward delay is zero or constant.
This means that the second constraint becomes:
* minimizing the number of memory blocks occupied by a given postsynaptic neuron.

Swapping
^^^^^^^^
What happens if synapse indexes i,j are swapped? I note Sf(i) the forward set of i (set of all synapses
that are simultaneously modified in the forward direction) and Sb(i) the backward set. I note B(i) the
memory block of i (which is a set of 32 indexes).
* A change in cost only occurs if B(i) and B(j) are different.
* A negative change in cost only occurs if B(i) or B(j) is represented only once in one of Sf(i), Sb(i), Sf(j), Sb(j).
  (That is, the intersection of B(i) and Sf(i) is just one element).
* The net change is:
	* -1 access in each set of (Sf(i),Sb(i)) where B(i) is represented only once 
	* +1 access in each set of (Sf(j),Sb(j)) where B(i) is not represented
	* -1 access in each set of (Sf(j),Sb(j)) where B(j) is represented only once 
	* +1 access in each set of (Sf(i),Sb(i)) where B(j) is not represented

One idea would be to pick a random synapse, and pick the best synapse to swap with.

Buffering
^^^^^^^^^
Another option is to apply synaptic changes only after some time, so as to access more memory
at the same time. This is not possible for all cases. In particular, propagation of spikes (v+=w)
has to be instantaneous. However, in this case we could imagine optimisations, e.g. reading w
at the time when spikes are produced rather than received (in this case we must minimize the
number of memory blocks occuper by a given presynaptic neuron).
