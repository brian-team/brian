Stream compaction / sorting method
==================================

The idea is to dump all the synaptic operations into a big queue, sort the
queue by synaptic target, and then fire off a bunch of threads that vectorise
over the queue.

Questions:
- if several events in sequence have the same target, how do we do accumulate
  these? this is essentially the problem of vectorising Synapses in Python,
  so maybe we can use the same solution? i.e. vectorise over indices without
  repeats, and loop over repeats.

Benefits:
- in principle, everything can be coalesced
Costs:
- we need to efficiently sort the synaptic operations, which is
  O(numevents log(numevents)), but there exist efficient sorting algorithms
  and libraries to do this
