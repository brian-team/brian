Plan for Brian on GPU
---------------------

* PyCuda installation (Windows): produce a binary?

From the CUBA example:

P=NeuronGroup(N,model=eqs,
              threshold=-50*mV,reset=-60*mV)

	* Create state matrix and maybe LS structure on GPU.
	* Create GPU update code from equations.
	* Create GPU threshold code.
	* Create GPU reset code.
	
P.v=-60*mV+10*mV*rand(len(P))

	* P.v is a view on the state matrix, with a special cached structure.
	  Uploading is only necessary before code is executed on the GPU.
	  Downloading is only necessary if CPU is not in sync with GPU.

Pe=P.subgroup(Ne)
Pi=P.subgroup(Ni)

	* Should work correctly if views are implemented on cached arrays.

Ce=Connection(Pe,P,'ge',weight=1.62*mV,sparseness=p)
Ci=Connection(Pi,P,'gi',weight=-9*mV,sparseness=p)

	* Create weight matrices on GPU (sparse array structure).
	* Create GPU propagate code.

M=SpikeMonitor(P)

	* Should work correctly (runs on CPU).
	  It could be useful if data were not transferred at every timestep,
	  using some sort of cache mechanism.

trace=StateMonitor(P,'v',record=0)

	* Should work correctly (runs on CPU).

run(1*second)
