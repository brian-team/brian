Connection matrix:
------------------
* dense
* sparse
* calculated (e.g. with random seeds)
* probabilistic (release probabilities)

 Should have operations for STDP / short-term plasticity

Operations:
** Construction **
* W[i,j]=... (setitem)
* W[i,j] (getitem) (view?)
* W[s1,s2]=... where s1,s2=slices (-> submatrix; connect function)
* freeze() (e.g. lil_matrix to faster version)
-> used when the structure (graph) will not change anymore
(use instead of compress())

** Propagation **
* X+=W[i,:] (propagation), where X is dense
  e.g. W.addrow(i,X)
* Short-term plasticity (modulation): X+=W[i,:]*scalar
  
** Plasticity **
Careful: dendritic or axonal delay?
* W[i,:]+=scalar or vector
* W[i,:]*=idem
* idem for columns
  maybe: W.set_row(i,x), set_column(j,x), add_row, etc.

Do we need views?

Event-driven algorithms
-----------------------
With homogeneous synaptic delays, event-driven algorithms should be possible
(otherwise it would be too slow because non-vectorisable).
The idea is that each tick of the clock is an emitted spike (next neuron to spike).
Algorithm for one spike:
* Find which neuron is spiking next (top of priority queue)
* Synchronous update of all target neurons (possibly delayed)
* Updates of spike timings of target neurons in priority queue
The last bit only needs to be done in C (e.g. inline function for a start).
It is even possible that spike timing updates are rare enough to be done in Python.

Is it possible to mix clock-driven and event-driven networks? (maybe)

The data structure should be very different. What is needed for a neuron group:
* Advance to a given time
* Spike timing calculation
* Reset function
Possibly, these could replace model, threshold and reset objects?
