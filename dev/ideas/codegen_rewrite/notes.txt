This folder is for work on stage 1 of the code generation rewrite project
detailed in:

http://groups.google.com/group/brian-development/browse_thread/thread/e51958b7785e48ef

In brief, stage 1 of the project involves:

* Write symbolic analysis package using Sympy
* Rewrite Equations using this
* Rewrite code generation to use this framework

Brief notes
===========

* Would like to be flexible enough to add support for things like differential
  equations specified as tau dV/dt = f(V,t) instead of just dV/dt = f(V, T).
  Could also leave space for more implicitly defined equations generally.
  Should also make a syntax like d2V/dt2 or (d/dt)**2 V or something like
  that possible in the future. Also, we should have syntax for stochastic
  differential equations.
  Basically, it should look as much like ordinary maths as possible.
  + Can we assume that equations can be reduced to dx/dt=f(x,t) after some
    transformations or not?
  + Do we want to leave space open for defining things like cable equations
    in a more sophisticated way? Any ideas on how to do this?

* For code generation, it might be useful to have a generated code base class
  that would handle variable initialisations, calling weave, maybe falling back
  on Python, etc. Something like the ConnectionCode class in new_c_propagate.
  The way this works is that each Code object would maintain a copy of its
  runtime code (either C or Python), its initialisation code (Python probably,
  but C also possible I guess), and its namespace. Combining code by nesting
  or concatenation would be possible, and would have to take into account the
  namespaces, initialisation code and runtime code. (See new_c_propagate for
  an example of how this works in practice.)

* We need a way of allowing objects to define a code generation equivalent.
  For example, TimedArray has a __call__ mechanism, but if you use a TimedArray
  in generated C code you will get an error. So TimedArray should be able to
  specify a C version of itself to be used with code generation. We might use
  weave's typemap system to do this (it maps Python objects to C objects). At
  the moment though it's undocumented.
  
* How to organise files? Should we have separate C files with template arguments
  for example? Or should we have strings mixed in with the Python code? Maybe
  a mix?

* Make use of:
  + Theano?
  + numexpr for Python code if package is installed?
    - Seems to make some improvement for large N but actually slows it down for
      small N (see test code in PythonStateUpdater).
