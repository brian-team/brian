Some ideas for mini-projects which can be done semi-independently

Reducing systems of equations to standard form
----------------------------------------------

Given a system of equations of a form like the following:

  a * d2x/dt2 + b * d2y/dt2 = c
  d * d2x/dt2 + e * d2y/dt2 = f
  
Write a module using Sympy to simplify to a system of first order ODEs. Note
that Sympy doesn't support the d2x/dt2 syntax, for example, so you would
need to do some pattern matching and replacement preprocessing beforehand,
e.g. replace 'dNX/dtN' with a fixed symbol, say _diff_N_X and have a lookup
table that matches symbols _diff_N_X to the original pattern 'dNX/dtN' and to
the pair (N, X) identifying the equation and order of the differential. With
these symbols, the equations could be solved using Sympy, and then reduced by
introducing auxiliary variables.
