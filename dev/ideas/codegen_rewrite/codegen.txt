Overview
========

Start with a series of statements we want to evaluate for each neuron, or for
each synapse, such as:

	State update (for each neuron):

		_temp_V = -V/tau
		V += _temp_V*dt
	
	Threshold (for each neuron):
	
		_spiked = V>Vt
		
	Reset (for each neuron in _spikes):
	
		V = 0
		
	Propagation (for each synapse):
	
		V += w*mod

We then proceed to construct code to evaluate this for each of the required
indices (neurons, spikes, synapses), vectorising in Python when possible, or
inserting loops. This has several components:

Code object
===========

The Code object is responsible for storing and executing the finished code. It
consists of a code string and a namespace, and the code is executed inside the
namespace. There are PythonCode, CCode and GPUCode subclasses. The __call__
mechanism is used to execute the code, and the keyword arguments provided to
__call__ are inserted into the namespace.

Expressions and MathematicalStatement
=====================================

An expression is a mathematical expression such as 'x**2+y', given in Python
syntax. A statement is something like 'z = x**2+y' or 'z += 1'. We use the
standard Python syntax with one addition, a new operator := which is used to
define a new variable. We need this because in both Python and C, defining a
variable is different to writing to it. When converting to C, we need to
transform the expression into 'pow(x,2)+y' and this is handled by sympy (which
also does some algebraic simplification). Similarly, when defining a variable in
C we do something like 'double z = pow(x,2)+y'.

CodeItem, Block, Statement
==========================

Each of this is an item of code. A Statement is like a single line or unit of
code, a CodeItem can be anything, and a Block is a sequence of several code
items. Loops and if statements are types of blocks too. The key method that each
of these share is convert_to to return a code string in different languages.

Symbols and Dependencies
========================

The key element in the whole scheme is the idea of Symbols and Dependencies.
To illustrate this, in the example of state update we have:

	_temp_V = -V/tau
	V += _temp_V*dt
	
Here, the symbol V 'depends on' the symbol neuron_index. That is, for each
neuron_index, we have a corresponding value of V. In turn, neuron_index takes
on multiple values. In Python, we go through the multiple values of
neuron_index by vectorisation, whereas in C we do it through a loop.

We generate the final code, by going through all the symbols in a code item
and 'resolving' the symbol, which means transforming the code. For example,
resolving 'V' in Python would mean 'V = _arr_V[neuron_index]' and in C it would
be 'double &V = _arr_V[neuron_index];'. Having resolved V it introduces a new
symbol neuron_index that needs to be resolved. In the case of Python this would
be 'neuron_index = slice(None)' whereas in C it would involve a loop.

There are two types of dependencies, Read and Write depending on how the symbol
is used. So, in Python we can read a numpy array just using the symbol name
directly, whereas to write to it we need to write 'V[:] = ...' to make the
modification in-place.

A symbol can say whether it is single or multiple valued, so that V is single
valued because it has a single value for a single value of neuron_index which
is the variable that takes multiple values.

A symbol can also say whether or not it needs a loop to resolve it or not, this
information can be used to optimise the code (we prefer to put as much stuff
outside loops as possible).

In resolving a symbol, we specify whether or not we want to read or write (or
both), and whether or not we can vectorise. The reason for this is that we can
only vectorise over one loop, so if we have two loops, then we have to loop over
one and vectorise over the other. This is determined by the symbol resolution
algorithm (see below). In resolving a variable we also have a code item and a
namespace. The symbol resolution returns a new code item and can modify the
namespace (e.g. adding new values to it, such as _arr_V).

We can also change the read/write names of the variable, for example when
writing to V we want to do _arr_V[:]=... whereas when reading from it we want
to just use _arr_V, so the Symbol object has read() and write() methods which
give the names to use when reading to or writing to a symbol.

In this way, we build up a complete code string iteratively by resolving one
variable at a time. For example for state update above, we would start by
resolving V, which would mean:

	Python:
		V = _arr_V[neuron_index]
		_temp_V = -V/tau
		_arr_V[neuron_index] += _temp_V*dt
	C:
		double &V = _arr_V[neuron_index];
		double _temp_V = -V/tau;
		V += _temp_V*dt;

This introduces a new symbol neuron_index which we need to resolve:

	Python:
		neuron_index = slice(None)
		V = _arr_V[neuron_index]
		_temp_V = -V/tau
		_arr_V[neuron_index] += _temp_V*dt
	C:
		for(int neuron_index=0; neuron_index<num_neurons; neuron_index++)
		{
			double &V = _arr_V[neuron_index];
			double _temp_V = -V/tau;
			V += _temp_V*dt;
		}

And this is the final code we execute.

There are two main types of symbols predefined, ArraySymbol and Index. The first
says that the Symbol is an element of an array, and Index is a multi-valued
array index. There are two types of Index symbols, SliceIndex which is used
for operating over a whole array or a slice of an array, and ArrayIndex which
is used for operating over a subset of the indices of an array, given by an
index array (e.g. _spikes).

We can extend the code generation by allowing users to provide their own
symbols, or using this mechanism with built in Brian objects. For example,
TimedArray can be implemented with this system. Symbols can be extracted from
the namespace of an Equations object by checking the type of each element in
the namespace, and, for example, checking if it has a method .codegen_symbol().

Symbol resolution algorithm
===========================

Consider the synaptic propagation statement:

	V += w*mod
	
Here we have that V depends on target_index, w depends on synapse_index and
mod is a presynaptic variable so it depends on source_index. In turn,
target_index depends on synapse_index, synapse_index depends on source_index,
and source_index depends on _spikes (the array of neurons which have spiked).
Summarising:

	V: depends on target_index, single-valued
	w: depends on synapse_index, single-valued
	mod: depends on source_index, single-valued
	target_index: depends on synapse_index, single-valued
	synapse_index: depends on source_index, multi-valued
	source_index: depends on _spikes, multi-valued
	
An issue is the order in which we resolve the symbols. Since we can only make
code modifications iteratively by adding additional code to the beginning and
ending of a given segment, if we resolved source_index first, we wouldn't then
be able to resolve synapse_index (because it depends on the value of
source_index).

The solution to this problem is to construct the whole dependency graph (which
means each Symbol has to have a method giving the set of dependencies it
introduces in its resolution), and then find the resolution order backwards
(i.e. we find the last symbol to be resolved first) at each stage choosing only
nodes in the graph with no outgoing edges. We can also perform an optimisation
by asking each node whether it requires a loop to resolve it, and always
preferring statements which don't require a loop first. In the above example,
the reverse order we get is then:

  source_index mod synapse_index w target_index V
  
So we resolve in the order:

  V target_index w synapse_index mod source_index
  
The dependency graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and therefore it is
guaranteed that we will find a suitable order (a topological sorting always
exists for DAGs). Since source_index and synapse_index are multi-valued, and
we resolve in the order above, we only vectorise for these symbols:

	V target_index w synapse_index
	
The remaining symbols have to be resolved without vectorisation (which makes
no difference in C but means Python loops).

Numerical integration
=====================

For generating code, we first generate an integration scheme for the equations,
and then create a symbol for each neuron group variable that depends on the
index neuron_index. To create the integration scheme, we do something like
this:

	def euler(eqs):
	    for var, expr in eqs.nonzero:
	        yield '_temp_{var} := {expr}'.format(var=var, expr=expr)
	    for var, expr in eqs.nonzero:
	        yield '{var} += _temp_{var}*dt'.format(var=var, expr=expr)

This generator yields strings which are turned into MathematicalStatements
by using regular expression analysis of the strings. See integration.py for
more details (it's simple).

Threshold, Reset
================

These work similarly to numerical integration. In the case of threshold, we
construct an array _spiked in the case of Python, then return _spiked.nonzero().
In the case of C we directly create an array _spikes.

For resets, we do the same as numerical integration, we create symbols for each
neuron group variable, but the neuron_index symbol is an ArrayIndex to the
array _spikes.

Propagation
===========

For propagation, it is a little more complicated because we have different
matrix types. So we define a Value, SynapseIndex and TargetIndex symbol for
each matrix type. For the moment, we only have 'V += w' or 'V += w*mod' so we
don't need to worry about inferring whether variables are pre- or post-synaptic
but for the Synapses class we will need to define or infer this somehow.
