Introduction
============

Code generation works using code blocks, each code block has a set of used
symbols and a set of dependencies, namely a set of symbols which have to be
handled before the current code can run. For example, if we were computing

	V += 1

for a whole NeuronGroup, we would start with that statement, then we would see
that there was a symbol V not yet resolved. The block is then:

	V += 1
	Dependencies: V

Depending on the language, we can
resolve that symbol in many different ways. In Python, we would just copy the
symbol V directly into the namespace. However, when we modify V we need to
do an in-place modification, so the Python code would look like:

	V[:] += 1
	
In C, we would need to do a loop over the neuron indices. We would handle this
by resolving the dependency of V by adding a statement as follows, but also
adding a new dependency:

	double &V = _arr_V[neuron_index];
	V += 1;
	Dependencies: _arr_V, neuron_index
	
The _arr_V is loaded directly into the namespace, so that dependency is easily
resolved. The neuron_index dependency is handled by looping:

	for(int neuron_index=0; neuron_index<num_neurons; neuron_index++)
	{
		double &V = _arr_V[neuron_index];
		V += 1;
	}
	Dependencies: num_neurons
	
Similarly num_neurons is added to the namespace and so now all dependencies are
resolved.

For GPU, we need to do something slightly different, because we don't loop to
resolve the dependency, we use the thread index, so when resolving neuron_index
we do this instead:

	__global__ void f(double *_arr_V)
	{
		int neuron_index = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
		double &V = _arr_V[neuron_index];
		V += 1;
	}

Technical details
=================

Code blocks consist of a set of dependencies and a sequence of code items, which
can be any of:

	Code block
	String
	Statement
	Loops??? (want to hard code this structure?)
	
Indentation should be handled (it's important in Python).

Statements have the form:

	variable op expression
	
Where variable is a variable name, op is an operator and expression is a
mathematical expression which itself can have many symbols contained in it.
The operators are:

	=					Set LHS = RHS
	:=					Define new symbol LHS and set value to RHS
	*=, +=, etc.		In-place modification of LHS to RHS
	
Expressions are given in Python syntax, and converted to C syntax if necessary
using sympy (e.g. x**2 -> pow(x,2)). Statements are overall in Python syntax
except that := is not part of Python. We need := for full flexibility, but we
can infer it in many cases (e.g. when LHS = RHS and LHS is a variable not yet
defined). We could handle this by requiring its use or by inference.

Statements and code strings can be analysed, their symbols extracted and looked
up in a table or by value in the calling/defining code namespace, and the
appropriate actions to resolve them extracted. The appropriate action depends
on how the symbol is used:

	read		symbol appears in expression
	write		symbol appears on LHS of statement
	
In each case, we may need to apply a context sensitive transformation to the
symbol. For example, in-place modification of a Python array is done by:

	V = ... -> V[:] = ...
	
Or, we might be operating on only a subset of the indices, in which case:

	V = ... -> V[indices] = ...
	
There is some space here to think about optimisations, e.g. if I write V*V
I don't want it transformed to V[indices]*V[indices] but instead have a
statement V_indices = V[indices] added before, and then V_indices*V_indices.

Code transformations that might be necessary are:

- Introduce a new variable into the namespace
- Rewrite read/write in a statement, e.g. V->V[:]
- Add load/save code after statements, e.g. V_indices=V[indices]
- Introduce a loop, and indent existing statements
- Move statements out of loops for optimisation reasons?
	Note that this requires having a notion of a loop doesn't it? And also
	maintaining slightly finer control over the idea of a statement, e.g.
	code such as double &V = _arr_V[neuron_index]; would have to be
	movable, which means keeping an idea of the purpose of the statement
	(resolves 'V', introduces dependency on 'neuron_index').
	
May also consider having a set of standard variable names with context-sensitive
resolution rules, namely:

	neuron_index
		Either an int in C, or in Python either a slice or array of ints. Used
		when iterating over neurons.
	source_index
		As neuron_index but used in synaptic event handling, and refers to the
		source neuron.
	target_index
		As neuron_index but used in synaptic event handling, and refers to the
		target neuron.
	synapse_index
		As neuron_index but referring to the index of the synapse in synaptic
		event handling.

Dependencies can be:

	read
	write

We have to be careful about the order in which symbols are resolved, because
the resolution of one symbol can make the resolution of another symbol
impossible. For example, if we have a synaptic propagation statement:

	V += w*mod
	
where V is a target variable, w is a synaptic variable, and mod is a source
variable, then V depends on target_index, w depends on synapse_index and mod
depends on source_index. Other dependencies are: target_index depends on
synapse_index, synapse_index depends on source_index. So the dependency graph
looks something like this (where a->b means that resolving a introduces a
new symbol b to be resolved):

   'V'      'w'     'mod'
    |        |        |
	v        v        v
  'tgt' -> 'syn' -> 'src'
  
If we chose to resolve mod, then src first, then when we came to resolve syn
we wouldn't be able to, because when we resolve a variable we can only
introduce changes before or after a block of code, and resolving syn would
mean reintroducing a dependency on src which is not possible (remember, we
are working outwards from inner loops to outer loops).

The solution to this problem is to construct the whole dependency graph (which
means each Symbol has to have a method giving the set of dependencies it
introduces in its resolution), and then find the resolution order backwards
(i.e. we find the last symbol to be resolved first) at each stage choosing only
nodes in the graph with no outgoing edges. We can also perform an optimisation
by asking each node whether it requires a loop to resolve it, and always
preferring statements which don't require a loop first. In the above example,
the reverse order we get is then:

  src mod syn w tgt V (the last three are interchangeable)
  
So we resolve in the order:

  V tgt w syn mod src
  
Which has this loop structure:

  for src in spikes:
    mod = ...
    for syn in row[src]:
      w = w(syn)
      tgt = tgt(syn)
      V = V(tgt)
      V += w
      
The dependency graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and therefore it is
guaranteed that we will find a suitable order (a topological sorting always
exists for DAGs).

- Finish basic implementation
- Dependencies aren't handled correctly (some resolved stay dependent for block)
- Dependencies from C/Python keywords and namespace (e.g. int, exp)
