INSTALLING PYPAR ON WINDOWS
===========================
* Download and install MPICH2 (binary installer for Windows); you need to
give a password (same as when logging?)
* Add C:\Program Files\MPICH2\bin to your Path environment variable.
* Your Windows user account needs to be password protected (if not,
go to the control panel / user accounts and set a password).
* Run wmpiregister and register your user name and password.
* Download pypar.
* Open setup.py and replace the command get_mpi_flags by the following:
def get_mpi_flags():
    return {'inc_dirs': ['C:\Program Files\MPICH2\include'],'lib_dirs': ['C:\Program Files\MPICH2\lib'], 'libs':['mpi'],
            'def_macros': [], 'undef_macros': []}
and check the directories.
* setup.py install (possibly with MSVC 2003 but maybe not necessarily)
* To run a python script on two processors, use:
mpiexec -n 2 python myscript.py
Alternatively, use the mpiexec wrapper (in Programs) and
write e.g. python C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages\pypar\test_init.py
and select the number of processors. The job can be saved.
