Brian Quality Day
=================
7 June 2010
-----------
Done:
* More tests for equations
* LinearStateUpdater
* Style fixes
* Manual for utils.io

Victor:
* BEP on Simulation class
* Connectivity analysis (new module)
* A few examples from literature

Bertrand:
* Brianhears: examples and style fixes
* A few statistical functions

Romain:
* Tests for equations

Cyrille:
* LinearStateUpdater
* Examples and manual for statistics

Dan:
* Style fixes

-------------------------------------------------

* Remove old commented code [Dan/Romain]
* Remove deprecated/unused code [Dan/Romain]
* Check style (PEP-8): patch for blank lines before def f() [Dan]
* Check if everything is documented and has examples (especially new features) [Cyrille/Bertrand]

Focus on:
* connection
* stdp
* neurongroup (especially init)
* equations

and for these modules:
* reorganize [Dan/Romain]
* add docstrings [Dan/Romain]
* write tests [Cyrille/Bertrand/Dan/Romain]

For brianhears:
* check docstrings [Bertrand/Dan]
* write manual, examples and tests [Bertrand/Dan]

Some other ideas:
* Work out why static code analysis tools don't work with Brian in PyDev and fix
  that. This may involve removing exec and eval statements from Brian import.
  This would mean writing out all the units explicitly, for example, which could
  be done with a tool to generate that code.

Initial planning
----------------
Dan: style patch for blank lines before def f() (PEP-8), use the 'pep8' Python
     module to help with this.
Romain: tests for equations
Bertrand: examples/docs for brianhears
Cyrille: check examples/docs for new features

-- Initial message --
I was thinking of organising a "Brian Quality Day". Basically it would be an afternoon that we would devote to improving the code quality of Brian. Here's a list of possible things to do:
* writing docstrings, docs and comments
* writing examples (for features that are currently not illustrated)
* writing tests (in particular for the modules that we want to change, like equations)
* checking style (according to PEP-8)
* removing deprecated code or old comments
* checking TODOs in the code
* simplifying/reorganizing some code (specifically: connection and stdp)
* writing some docs in the developer's guide
There are also some thoughts in dev.Refactoring.txt.
We could even advertise that day on the google group, so that people could send us some tests for example.
The goal is that the code is more readable and easier to modify (which requires a better test coverage). This could also include brian.hears. Hopefully this should also give everyone a better idea of the structure of the code.
