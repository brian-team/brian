Brian 1 depends on Python 2.x, so running it on modern systems has become
more difficult. For convenience, we provide a Docker image that you can use
to run existing Brian 1 code. It is based on a Debian image, and provides
Brian 1.4.3, as packaged by the NeuroDebian team (https://neuro.debian.net/).
To use these images, you either need to have docker (https://docker.com),
podman (https://podman.io/) or singularity (https://https://sylabs.io/singularity/)
installed â€“ the commands below are shown for the `docker` command, but you can
simply replace them by `podman` if necessary. For singularity, the basic workflow
is similar but the commands are slightly different, please see the documentation.
To pull the container image with singularity, refer to
`docker://briansimulator/brian1.4.3`.

Running a graphical interface within the docker container can be complicated,
and the details how to make it work depend on the host operating system.
We therefore recommend to instead either 1) only use the container image to
generate and save the simulation results to disk, and then to create the plots
on the host system, or 2) to use the container image to plot files to disk by
adding `plt.savefig(...)` to the script. The container already sets the
matplotlib backend to `Agg` by default (by setting the environment variable
`MPLBACKEND`), necessary to avoid errors when no graphical interface is
available.

To download the image and to rename it to brian1 (for convenience only, the
commands below would also work directly with the full name), use:

    docker pull docker.io/briansimulator/brian1.4.3
    docker tag briansimulator/brian1.4.3 brian1

The following command runs `myscript.py` with the container image providing
Brian 1 and its dependencies, mapping the current directory to the working
directory in the container (this means, the script has access to all files in
the current directory and its subdirectories, and can also write files there):

    docker run -v "$(pwd):/workdir" brian1 python myscript.py
 
For Windows users using the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) instead of the Powershell,
the following command will do the same thing:

    docker run -v %cd%:/workdir brian1 python myscript.py

To run an interactive ipython prompt, use:

    docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/workdir" brian1 ipython

Depending on your operating system, files written by the container might be
owned by the user "root", which can lead to problems later (e.g. you cannot
rename/move/delete/overwrite the file on your home system without administrator
rights). On Unix-based systems, you can prevent this issue by running scripts
with the same user id as the host user:

    docker run -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v "$(pwd):/workdir" brian1 python myscript.py

Please report any issues to the Brian discussion forum:
https://brian.discourse.group

Version 1.4.3 to 1.4.4
----------------------
A minor bugfix release to fix incompatibilities with recent numpy versions
(>= 1.13), and to prepare for the removal of deprecated sympy features. Also
fixes a potential matplotlib issue with realtime plotting (contributed by
Pedro Machado)

Version 1.4.2 to 1.4.3
----------------------
A minor bugfix release to fix incompatibilities with the upcoming numpy
release. Also prepares for the removal of the `scipy.weave` package (replaced
by the `weave` package).

Version 1.4.1 to 1.4.2
----------------------
This is a bugfix release that does not add any major features. See the commit
log at http://neuralensemble.org/trac/brian/log/ for details. Note that our
development efforts are now entirely focused on Brian 2
(https://github.com/brian-team/brian2), this will most likely be the last
release in the 1.x series.

Version 1.4.0 to 1.4.1
----------------------

Major features:
* C extensions are compiled by default during installation (with a fallback to
  the Python version if compilation fails) -- this might lead to a considerable
  speedup for users who did not compile those extensions manually before 

Minor features:
* Convenience methods for the Synapses class, allowing to save and load the
  connectivity and to convert the weights into a matrix
* A new openmp option to switch on the use of OpenMP pragmas in generated C code
* Brian hears: Two new models, MiddleEar (filtering by the middle ear) and 
  ZhangSynapse (model of the IHC-AN synapse) 
* Brian hears: New convenience functions to get reasonable axis ticks for
  logarithmic axes
  
Improvements:
* Brian's documentation is now also available under brian.readthedocs.org
* ProgressReporter has context manager support (i.e. can be used in "with"
  statements)
* NeuronGroup and Synapses work with empty model specifications. 
* C version of SpikeContainer is now picklable
 
Bug fixes:
* Synaptic equations referring to variables in the pre- or postsynaptic group
  are never considered as being linear (fixes ticket #83)
* Fix issue with static equations in synaptic models (see
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/briansupport/-/uqxLK_yoqKUJ )
* Make LinearStateUpdater pickable, even if array B is "NotImplemented".
* Fixed the bug in which the StateSpikeMonitor didn't record variables defined
  with a static equation.
  
* Important bug fixes for brian hears, all users are encouraged to update:
	* Make sure that LinearFilterbank copies it source and therefore not
	  changes it (when not using weave) (fixes ticket #73)
	* Fix some bugs in the TanCarney model
	* Fix shifting multi-channel sounds with fractional=True (fixes ticket #80)

Experimental features:
* A C version of SpikeQueue (used in the Synapses class), which can lead to a
  considerable speedup (see "Advanced concepts/Compiled code" for instructions
  how to use it).
* Delays can be specified as a parameters of the Synapses model and then be
  changed dynamically.

Version 1.3.1 to 1.4.0
