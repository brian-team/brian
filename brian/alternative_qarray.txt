Alternative Quantity and QuantityArray design notes
===================================================

For consideration for Brian releases after 1.0.

The current Quantity and qarray design works as follows:

The class Dimension is implemented entirely in Python and defines
a tuple of indices of each of the 7 basic SI dimensions. The class
Quantity is derived from numpy's float and adds a Dimension object.
The class qarray is derived from numpy's ndarray and adds a unit
array on top, which can be either homogeneous or not (corresponding
to classes homog_unitarray or unitarray). These classes are derived
from ndarray. Both store a copy of the units as Quantity objects with
float value 1.0. This system has multiple levels of indirection, and
the result is slow code. A qarray based on homogeneous units performs
worse than 10 times slower than a straight numpy array, whereas one
with nonhomogeneous units performs several thousand times slower (i.e.
unusable in practice for anything other than tiny arrays).

Alternative design strategy
---------------------------

This design strategy could be implemented in Python or C code, the
latter would be considerably faster.

Dimension class could be a numpy array.

Could define a DimensionArray class, which could potentially be
implemented directly as a numpy array with one extra dimension (so
that the DimensionArray of a class with shape S would be an
array with shape S+(7,). There would also be either a 
HomogeneousDimensionArray class which would essentially just store
one dimension and keep track of an appropriate shape, or the
alternative qarray class could keep track of this (maybe this is
actually better?).

Finally, an alternative QuantityArray class would be based on a
DimensionArray and an underlying ndarray. This would save many
levels of indirection and redundant processing, and because
everything would be based on numpy arrays, it should run much
faster.

Other considerations
--------------------

There is also the possibility of mixed homogeneous/non-homogeneous
units. For example, one column may have all units the same, whereas
another will have varying units. This ought to be possible to
implement.
