def raster_plot(*monitors, **additionalplotoptions):
    """Raster plot of a :class:`SpikeMonitor`
    
    **Usage**
    
    ``raster_plot(monitor,options...)``
        Plots the spike times of the monitor
        on the x-axis, and the neuron number on the y-axis
    ``raster_plot(monitor0,monitor1,...,options...)``
        Plots the spike times
        for all the monitors given, with y-axis defined by placing a spike
        from neuron n of m in monitor i at position i+n/m
    ``raster_plot(options...)``
        Guesses the monitors to plot automagically
    
    **Options**
    
    Any of PyLab options for the ``plot`` command can be given, as well as:
    
    ``showplot=False``
        set to ``True`` to run pylab's ``show()`` function
    ``newfigure=False``
        set to ``True`` to create a new figure with pylab's ``figure()`` function
    ``xlabel``
        label for the x-axis
    ``ylabel``
        label for the y-axis
    ``title``
        title for the plot    
    ``showgrouplines=False``
        set to ``True`` to show a line between each monitor
    ``grouplinecol``
        colour for group lines
    ``spacebetweengroups``
        value between 0 and 1 to insert a space between
        each group on the y-axis
    ``refresh``
        Specify how often (in simulation time) you would like the plot to
        refresh. Note that this will only work if pylab is in interactive mode,
        to ensure this call the pylab ``ion()`` command.
    ``showlast``
        If you are using the ``refresh`` option above, plots are much quicker
        if you specify a fixed time window to display (e.g. the last 100ms).
    ``redraw``
        If you are using more than one realtime monitor, only one of them needs
        to issue a redraw command, therefore set this to ``False`` for all but
        one of them.

    Note that with some IDEs, interactive plotting will not work with the
    default matplotlib backend, try doing something like this at the
    beginning of your script (before importing brian)::
    
        import matplotlib
        matplotlib.use('WXAgg')
        
    You may need to experiment, try WXAgg, GTKAgg, QTAgg, TkAgg.
