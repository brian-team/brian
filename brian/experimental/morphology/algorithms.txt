Algorithms for simulating branched cable equations
--------------------------------------------------
The state update for the cable equation can be done with Hines method:

And:

In Hines method, values of ionic currents are calculated at
midpoints of time steps as a function of V(t), and the
values of the conductances are considered as constant within
a timestep for the integration of the cable equation.
The cable equation uses a simple implicit scheme followed by
an explicit step. As I understand it, the update of Im (IHH in
the paper) and the integration of the cable equation are completely
independent. Therefore, we can have separate stateupdaters which are
called in the following order:
1) Update the spatial equation with Hines method.
2) Update the membrane current with a standard vectorized updater (2nd order?).
3) Update the point processes with a standard vectorized updater.
(actually I think 2 should be before 1, but it won't make a difference)

Mascagni's method is backward Euler, with the advantage that convergence is
guaranteed. The algorithm is as follows:
1) Solve the discrete system for V(t+dt), where the other variables are constant
and assumed to be known at time t+dt (first iteration: use value at t). This
is sparse linear system (could be computed with scipy.sparse.linalg?).
2) Solve for the other variables at t+dt using a backward Euler step with the
values of V from step 1. In principle this is a simple 1D linear system
(assuming conditional linearity for these variables).
3) Repeat until convergence (how many times?).

In comparison, Hines method uses a single iteration, which is solving a sparse
linear system as well (in fact the same one, but at time t+dt/2).
1) Calculate other variables at t+dt/2, by an Euler step from time t-dt/2,
that uses the values at time t for V, and estimated at time t for the other
variables using the average between t-dt/2 and t+dt/2 (this makes it implicit).
2) Solve for V(t+dt/2) then do a forward step to t+dt.
This looks to me like one step of the backward Euler method (except it's 2 then
1).
There is pseudo-code in Hines paper.

Both methods rely on the conditional linearity of the equations, therefore it
cannot work for all types of models (e.g. exponential model).

To deal with branches, there are two options:
1) Use Hines method.
2) Use domain decomposition. This means using the linearity of the problem
(it is linear once the other variables considered fixed, by conditional linearity)
to solve the equation separately on each branch and then combine them linearly.
The big advantage is that this way we can still use the solve_banded method of
scipy.

The simulation is in two stages:
1) Solve the discrete system for V(t+dt), where the other variables are constant
and assumed to be known at time t+dt (first iteration: use value at t). This
is a sparse linear system (could be computed with scipy.sparse.linalg?).
2) Calculate Im at t+dt using a backward Euler step with the
values of V from step 1. That is, do one step of implicit Euler.
And possibly repeat (until convergence) (how many times?).

The discretized longitudinal current is:
a/(2*R)*(V[i+1]-2*V[i]+V[i-1])/dx**2

Artificial gridpoints are used so that:
(V[1]-V[-1])/(2*dx) = dV/dt(0)   # =0 in general
(V[N+1]-V[N-1])/(2*dx) = dV/dt(L)   # =0 in general

Consider also the capacitive current (and leak?).

Actually in Mascagni it's more complicated, because we use the
full membrane equation (conductances in front V in particular).
Therefore perhaps we would need sympy to reorganize the equation first
as dV/dt=aV+b (see the Synapses class).

x=scipy.linalg.solve_banded((lower,upper),ab,b)
    lower = number of lower diagonals
    upper = number of upper diagonals
    ab = array(l+u+1,M)
        each row is one diagonal
    a[i,j]=ab[u+i-j,j]

Domain decomposition
--------------------
Consider two connected cables, with the junction point at distance L.
The linear equations (that is, assuming fixed variables other than v) are:
L_A v^A = I^A
L_B v^B = I^B
for the two cables A and B.
Continuity requirements are:
* v^A(L)=v^B(0)  # potential
* d/dx v^A(L)=d/dx v^B(0)  # current
There are homogeneous boundardy conditions on the two ends (zero current).

Consider the first equation, with boundary condition at 0 and free (unknown) voltage at L.
Then the set of solutions is a linear one-dimensional manifold:
v^A = k*v_0^A + v_*^A
where v_0^A is a solution to the homogeneous equation, and v_*^A is a particular solution.
For example, choose:
* v_0(L)=1 and v_*^A(L)=0
Then v^A(L)=k.

The same can be done for cable B.
The two continuity requirements mean that:
* the constants (k) are identical
* they are determined by a linear equation expressing the continuity of current at L:
  k (d/dx v_0^A - d/dx v_0^B) = d/dx v_*^B - d/dx v_*^A

Therefore, an algorithm is:
* Solve 2 tridiagonal systems per branch.
* Solve the unknowns by a linear system with the dimension of the order of the number of branches
* Do linear combinations.
The first and third steps can be done in parallel.

When the branches connect on both ends, we need two unknown constants per branch. This is solved as follows:
* Particular solution v_*(0)=v_*(L)=0
* Homogeneous solution v_0(0)=1 and v_0(L)=0
* Homogeneous solution v_1(0)=0 and v_0(L)=1
* Combination: v = v_*(0) + v(0)v_0 + v(L)v_L (v(0) and v(L) are the two unknowns)

Alternatively, boundary conditions could be expressed as currents rather than potentials.
When there are several branches, we simply change to current continuity condition to Kirchoff's law.
