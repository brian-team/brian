Plasticity
==========

.. note:: The classes below are only working with the :class:`Connection` class.
   Consider using the newer :class:`Synapses` class as a replacement, it
   allows you to flexibily express plasticity rules in a very similar way to
   the classes below. A single :class:`Synapses` object can therefore
   completely replace the combination of :class:`Connection` +
   :class:`STDP`, for example. See :doc:`synapses` for more details.
