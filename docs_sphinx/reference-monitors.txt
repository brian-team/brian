Monitors
--------

Monitors are used to record properties of your network. The two
most important are :class:`SpikeMonitor` which records spikes, and
:class:`StateMonitor` which records values of state variables. These
objects are just added to the network like a :class:`NeuronGroup` or
:class:`Connection`.

Implementation note: monitors that record spikes are classes
derived from :class:`Connection`, and overwrite the ``propagate`` method
to store spikes. If you want to write your own custom spike
monitors, you can do the same (or just use :class:`SpikeMonitor` with
a custom function). Monitors that record values are classes
derived from :class:`NetworkOperation` and implement the ``__call__``
method to store values each time the network updates. Custom
state monitors are most easily written by just writing your
own network operation using the ``network_operation``
decorator.
