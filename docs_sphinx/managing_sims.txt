Managing simulation runs and data
=================================

Often, you want to run a simulation multiple times with different parameters
to generate data for a plot. There are many different ways to manage this,
and Brian has a few tools to make it easier.

Saving data by hand
-------------------

The simplest strategy is to run your simulation, and then save the data with
a unique filename using either
`pickle <http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html>`__, writing text or binary
data to a file
`with Python <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/inputoutput.html>`__, or with
`Numpy <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.io.html>`__ and
`Scipy <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/io.html>`__.

Structured data formats
-----------------------

Another option is to use a more structured file type, for example, you could
use the high performance `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`__ scientific
data file format with `PyTables <http://www.pytables.org>`__.

Python also includes an object for storing data in a dictionary like database
object with the `shelve module <http://docs.python.org/library/shelve.html>`__.

Brian includes a simple modification of Python's shelves to make it easy to
generate data in parallel on a single machine or across several machines. The
problem with Python shelves and HDF5 is that they cannot be accessed by several
processes on a single machine concurrently (if two processes attempt to write
to the file at the same time it gets corrupted). In addition, if you want to
run simulations on two computers at once and merge them you have to write a
separate program to merge the databases produced. With the
:class:`~brian.tools.datamanager.DataManager` class, you generate a directory
containing multiple files, and the data can be distributed amongst these files.
To merge the results generated on two different computers just copy the
contents of one directory into the other. The way it works is that to write
data to a :class:`~brian.tools.datamanager.DataManager`, you first generate a
''session'' object (which is essentially a Python shelf object) and then
write data to that. However, when you want to read data, it will look in all
the files in the directory and return merged data from them. Typically, a
session file will have the form ``username.computername`` so that merging
directories across multiple computers/users is straightforward (no name
conflicts). You can also create a ''locking session''. This object can be
used in multiple processes concurrently without danger of losing data.

Multiple runs in parallel
-------------------------

The Python
`multiprocessing <http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html>`__
module can be used for relatively simply distributing simulation runs over
multiple CPUs. Alternatively, you could use
`Playdoh <http://code.google.com/p/playdoh/>`__ (produced by our group) to
distribute work over multiple CPUs and multiple machines. For other solutions,
see the "Parallel and distributed programming" section of the
`Scipy Topical Software <http://www.scipy.org/Topical_Software>`__ page.

Brian provides a simple, single machine technique that works with the
:class:`~brian.tools.datamanager.DataManager` object,
:func:`~brian.tools.taskfarm.run_tasks`. With this, you provide a function and
a sequence of arguments to that function, and the function calls will be
evaluated across multiple CPUs, with the results being stored in the data
manager. It also features a GUI which gives feedback on simulations as they
run, and can be used to safely stop the processes without risking losing any
data. A simple example of using this technique::

	from brian import *
	from brian.tools.datamanager import *
	from brian.tools.taskfarm import *
	
	def find_rate(k, report):
	    eqs = '''
	    dV/dt = (k-V)/(10*ms) : 1
	    '''
	    G = NeuronGroup(1000, eqs, reset=0, threshold=1)
	    M = SpikeCounter(G)
	    run(30*second, report=report)
	    return (k, mean(M.count)/30)
	
	if __name__=='__main__':
	    N = 20
	    dataman = DataManager('taskfarmexample')
	    if dataman.itemcount()<N:
	        M = N-dataman.itemcount()
	        run_tasks(dataman, find_rate, rand(M)*19+1)
	    X, Y = zip(*dataman.values())
	    plot(X, Y, '.')
	    xlabel('k')
	    ylabel('Firing rate (Hz)')
	    show()

Finally, a more sophisticated solution for "managing and tracking projects,
based on numerical simulation or analysis, with the aim of supporting
reproducible research" is `Sumatra <http://neuralensemble.org/trac/sumatra/>`__.
