Installation
============

If you already have a copy of Python 2.5-2.7, try the `Quick installation`_ below,
otherwise take a look at `Manual installation`_.

Quick installation
------------------

easy_install / pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to install the most recent version of Brian if you already have
a version of Python 2.5-2.7 including the ``easy_install`` script is to simply
run the following in a shell::

	easy_install brian

This will download and install Brian and all its required packages (NumPy, SciPy, etc.).

Similarly, you can use the ``pip`` utility::

	pip install brian 

Note that there are some optimisations you can make after installation, see the
section below on `Optimisations`_.

Debian/Ubuntu packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use a Debian-based Linux distribution (in addition to Debian itself, this
includes for example Ubuntu or Linux Mint), you can install Brian directly
from your favourite package manager (e.g. Synaptic or the Ubuntu Software
Centre), thanks to the packages provided by the
`NeuroDebian <http://neuro.debian.net/>`__ team.

The package is called ``python-brian``, the documentation and tutorials can be
found in ``python-brian-doc``. To install these packages from the command-line
use::

	sudo apt-get install python-brian python-brian-doc

Note that in contrast to the procedure described above for
`easy_install / pip`_, you will not necessarily get the most recent version of
Brian this way. On the other hand, you do not have to take care of future
updates yourself, as the Brian package gets updated with the standard update
process. Additionally, the Brian package already includes all the compiled C
code mentioned in the `Optimisations`_ section.
Another way to install Brian which combines these advantages with up-to-date
versions is to directly add the
`NeuroDebian repository <http://neuro.debian.net/index.html#repository-howto>`__
to your software sources.

Manual installation
-------------------

Installing Brian requires the following components:

#. `Python <http://www.python.org/download/>`__ version 2.5-2.7.
#. `NumPy and Scipy <http://www.scipy.org/Download>`__ packages for Python:
   an efficient scientific library.
#. `PyLab <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`__ package for Python:
   a plotting library similar to Matlab 
   (see the `detailed installation instructions <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/installing.html>`__).
#. `SymPy <http://code.google.com/p/sympy/>`__ package for Python:
   a library for symbolic mathematics (not mandatory yet for Brian).
#. `Brian <http://neuralensemble.org/trac/brian/wiki/Downloads>`__ itself (don't forget to download the extras.zip file,
   which includes examples, tutorials, and a complete copy of the documentation).
   Brian is also a Python package and can be installed as explained below.

Fortunately, Python packages are very quick and easy to install, so the whole process shouldn't
take very long. 

We also recommend using the following for writing programs in Python (see details below):

#. `Eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org/>`__ IDE with `PyDev <http://pydev.sourceforge.net/>`__
#. `IPython <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/>`__ shell

Finally, if you want to use the (optional) automatic C++ code generation features of Brian, you should
have the ``gcc`` compiler installed (on `Cygwin <http://www.cygwin.com/>`__ if you are
running on Windows).

Mac users: The Enthought Python Distribution (`EPD <http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php/>`__ ) is free for academics and contains all the libraries necessary to run Brian. Otherwise, the `Scipy Superpack for Intel OS X <http://fonnesbeck.github.com/ScipySuperpack/>`__ also includes versions of Numpy, Scipy, Pylab and IPython.

Windows users: the `Python(x,y) <http://www.pythonxy.com/>`__ distribution includes all the packages
(including Eclipse and IPython) above except Brian (which is available as an optional plugin).

Another option is the `Anaconda distribution <http://continuum.io/anaconda.html>`__, which also includes
all the packages above except Brian and Eclipse.

Installing Python packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Windows, Python packages (including Brian) are generally installed simply by running an .exe file.
On other operating systems, you can download the source release (typically a compressed
archive .tar.gz or .zip that you need to unzip) and then install the package by typing the following in your
shell::

	python setup.py install

Installing Eclipse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Eclipse is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for any programming language. PyDev is a plugin
for Eclipse with features specifically for Python development. The combination of these two is
excellent for Python development (it's what we use for writing Brian).

To install Eclipse, go to `their web page <http://www.eclipse.org/>`__ and download any of the base
language IDEs. It doesn't matter which one, but Python is not one of the base languages so you have
to choose an alternative language. Probably the most useful is the C++ one or the Java one. The C++
one can be downloaded `here <http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/downloads.php>`__.

Having downloaded and installed Eclipse, you should download and install the PyDev plugin from
`their web site <http://pydev.sourceforge.net/>`__. The best way to do this is directly from within
the Eclipse IDE. Follow the instructions on the `PyDev manual page <http://pydev.org/manual_101_root.html>`__.

Installing IPython
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`IPython <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/>`__ is an interactive shell for Python.
It has features for SciPy and PyLab built in, so it is a good choice for scientific work.
Download from `their page <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/Download>`__. If you are using Windows, you
will also need to download PyReadline from the same page.

C++ compilers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default for Brian is to use the ``gcc`` compiler which will
be installed already on most unix or linux distributions. If you are using Windows, you can
install `cygwin <http://www.cygwin.com/>`__ (make sure to include the ``gcc`` package). Alternatively,
some but not all versions of Microsoft Visual C++ should be compatible, but this is untested
so far. See the documentation for the `SciPy Weave <http://www.scipy.org/Weave>`__ package for
more information on this. Mac users should have XCode installed so as to have access to gcc and hence take advantage of brian compiled code. See also the section on :ref:`compiled-code`.


Testing
-------
You can test whether Brian has installed properly by running Python and typing
the following two lines::

	from brian import *
	brian_sample_run()

A sample network should run and produce a raster plot.

Optimisations
-------------

After a successful installation, there are some optimisations you can make to
your Brian installation to get it running faster using compiled C code. We do
not include these as standard because they do not work on all computers, and
we want Brian to install without problems on all computers. Note that including
all the optimisations can result in significant speed increases (around 30%).

These optimisations are described in detail in the section on :ref:`compiled-code`.
